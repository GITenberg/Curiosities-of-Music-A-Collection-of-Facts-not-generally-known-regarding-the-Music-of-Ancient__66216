<h2><span class="small">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<p>In this work, I have endeavored to bring together
the most curious points in the music of
many nations, ancient and modern. As the
work originally appeared in a magazine (&ldquo;The
Vox Humana&rdquo;) I was obliged to avoid any extended
research into disputed points, such as
Hebrew music, Greek music, water organs, etc.,
as being too abstruse for periodical reading. Yet
many of the facts contained in its columns have
not yet found their way into English literature.
This was so entirely the case with Chinese music,
that I was tempted to somewhat transgress my
limits on this subject, it being, apparently, a
neglected one. In all the other chapters I have
merely sought out such facts as would interest,
and present a comprehensive idea to the general
reader, whether musical or not.</p>
<p>My hearty thanks are due to Col. Henry Ware,
and Mr. J. Norton, of Boston, for many facilities
afforded and suggestions offered, in the course
of compiling this book. If it fills an unoccupied
niche, however small, in musical literature, it will
have fulfilled the desire of</p>

<h1 title="">CURIOSITIES OF MUSIC.</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Music has been broadly defined by Fetis as &ldquo;the
art of moving the feelings by combinations of
sounds;&rdquo; taken in this broad sense it may be
considered as coeval with the human race.</p>
<p>Vocal music, in a crude form, is as natural in
man, to express feelings, as it is for a cat to purr
or a lion to roar; as regards instrumental music,
the primitive man might have found in every hollow
tree a reverberating drum, and in every
conchshell or horn of cattle, the natural beginnings
of instrumental music; we shall find later
that many nations ascribe the discovery of their
music to the accidental appliance of some
natural instrument; our surest guide in watching
the rise of the art, should be the manner in which
savage peoples, yet in a state of nature, produce
music, and we shall find too, that even the lowest
in the scale, even those beings who make the
monkey tribe nearer and dearer to us, as possible
relatives (the bushmen of Australia for example),
have still a method of &ldquo;moving the feelings by
means of combinations of sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>It is therefore, really in barbarous nations, that
we may, reasoning by analogy, find in what state
music existed when our own ancestors were in a
state of nature; but in order to give a more chronological
character to our sketches we will begin
with the <i>Music and Musical Mythology of the
Ancients</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c2">THE HINDOOS.</h3>
<p>With this people, and the Egyptians we find
proofs of the existence of a musical system at a
time which far antedates the earliest reliable
Scriptural records.</p>
<p>Among the Hindoos especially, as far back as
history extends, music has been treated not only
as a fine art, but philosophically and mathematically.
According to the oldest Brahminical records,
in their all-embracing &ldquo;Temple of Science,&rdquo;
it belongs to the 2d chief division of Lesser Sciences,
but its natural and philosophic elements,
are, with a nice distinction, admitted into their
holiest and oldest book, the <i>Veda</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Of course it
has a divine origin ascribed to it, in fact the entire
realm of Indian music is one tale of Mythology.</p>
<p>According to Brahminical accounts, when Brahma
had lain in the egg three thousand billion,
four hundred million of years (3,000,400,000,000)
he split it by the force of his thought and made
Heaven and Earth from the two pieces; then
Manu brought forth ten great forces, which made
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Gods, Goddesses, good and evil spirits and Gandharbas
(Genii of music), and Apsarasas (Genii of
Dance), and these became the musicians of the
Gods, before man knew of the art. Then Sarisvati,
Goddess of Speech and Oratory, consort of
Brahma, at Brahma&rsquo;s command brought the art
to man and gave him also his finest musical instrument,
the Vina, of which hereafter. Music
then found a protector in the demi-god Nared,
one of the chief Indian musical deities, while
Maheda Chrishna helped it along by allowing five
keys, or modes, to spring from his head (<i>a la</i>
Minerva) in the shape of Nymphs, and his wife
Parbuti, added one more; then Brahma added
thirty lesser keys, or modes, and all these modes
were also Nymphs.</p>
<p>The Hindoo scale has seven chief tones and
these tones are represented as so many heavenly
sisters.</p>
<p>In the Indian legends, music is represented as
of immense might. All men, all animals, all inanimate
nature listened to the singing of Maheda
and Parbuti with ecstasy.</p>
<p>Some modes were never to be sung by mortals,
as they were so fiery that the singer would be
consumed by them. In the time of Akber, it is
related, that ruler commanded Naik Gobaul,
a famous singer, to sing the Raagni<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> of Fire; the
poor singer entreated in vain, to be allowed to
sing a less dangerous strain; then he plunged up
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
to his neck in the river Djumna, and began: he
had not finished more than half of his lay when
the water around him began to boil; he paused
(at boiling point) but the relentless, or curious
Akber, demanded the rest, and with the end of
the song the singer burst into flames and was consumed.
Another melody caused clouds to rise
and rain to fall; a female singer is said once to
have saved Bengal from famine and drought in
this manner. Another lay caused the sun to disappear
and night to come at midday, or another
could change winter to spring or rain to sunshine.
All these typify beautifully the might of music
with this race. Of the four chief tone systems,
two also have divine origin, from Iswara and
from Hanuman (the Indian Pan), the others
come from Bharata Muni who invented the
drama with music and dance, and from Calinath.</p>
<p>When Chrishna was upon the earth as a shepherd,
there were sixteen thousand pastoral Nymphs
or Shepherdesses who fell in love with him.&mdash;They
all tried to win his heart by music, and
each one sang him a song, and each one sang in a
<i>different key</i>, (let us hope not all at once). Thence
sprang the sixteen thousand keys, which according
to tradition once existed in India.</p>
<p>In order that the full extent of Hindoo Musical
Mythology may be conceived, we will now sketch
the tones which are employed.</p>
<p>We have stated that there are seven chief tones;
these tones have short monosyllabic names; as we
give to our notes the syllables, <i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, etc., the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Hindoos call their scale tones <i>sa</i>, <i>ri</i>, <i>ga</i>, <i>ma</i>, <i>pa</i>,
<i>dha</i>, <i>ni</i>, <i>sa</i>, which are certainly as easy to vocalise
upon as our <i>solfeggi</i>; in fact the language is very
well adapted to music, as it has all the softness,
elegance and clearness of the Italian. Von Dalberg
says that Sanscrit unites the splendor of the
Spanish, the strength of the German, and the
singableness of the Italian.</p>
<p>With the resemblance of seven chief tones, however,
the similarity ends, for while our scale has
only half tones as smallest interval, the Hindoos
have quarter tones, and not equally distributed
either; thus:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td> </td><td class="cs">whole tone </td><td> </td><td class="cs">small whole </td><td> </td><td class="cs">half tone </td><td> </td><td class="cs">whole tone </td><td> </td><td class="cs">whole tone </td><td> </td><td class="cs">small whole </td><td> </td><td class="cs">half tone</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sa </td><td> </td><td>Ri </td><td> </td><td>Ga </td><td> </td><td>Ma </td><td> </td><td>Pa </td><td> </td><td>Dha </td><td> </td><td>Ni </td><td> </td><td>Sa</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td class="cs">&frac14;&frac14;&frac14;&frac14; </td><td> </td><td class="cs">&frac14;&frac14;&frac14; </td><td> </td><td class="cs">&frac14;&frac14; </td><td> </td><td class="cs">&frac14;&frac14;&frac14;&frac14; </td><td> </td><td class="cs">&frac14;&frac14;&frac14;&frac14; </td><td> </td><td class="cs">&frac14;&frac14;&frac14; </td><td> </td><td class="cs">&frac14;&frac14;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In theory it will be seen that the octave is always
a half tone flat, but practically they correct
this by singing it on its proper pitch. On six of
the above intervals they found their chief modes
but they form various lesser modes on each interval,
i. e., they could give ten different modes, or
scales, starting from C alone.</p>
<p>These six chief styles, are, of course, six Genii,
corresponding to the six Hindoo divisions of the
year, these are each married to five Nymphs, the
thirty lesser styles; each Genii has eight sons,
who are each wedded, also to Nymphs, one apiece.
There seem to be few celibates in Hindoo Mythology,
therefore an exact census gives to this
interesting family six fathers, thirty mothers, forty-eight
sons, forty-eight daughters-in-law, or one
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
hundred thirty-two in all, each of them being the
God or Goddess of some particular key, and each
of them, of course, having a distinctive name; we
shall not give the various names, but to illustrate
the relationship among them, the following will
suffice; the four 1-4 tones beginning on the fifth
tone of the scale, <i>Panchama</i> (or <i>Pa</i>) are the
Nymphs <i>Malina</i>, <i>Chapala</i>, <i>Lola</i> and <i>Serveretna</i>,
while the next full tone (<i>Dha</i>) is owned by Santa
and her sisters; if <i>Dha</i> should be flatted 1-4 tone
which would give it the same pitch as the highest
1-4 tone of <i>Pa</i>, (called Serveretna), the poetical
Hindoo would not say &ldquo;<i>Dha</i> is flat,&rdquo; but &ldquo;<i>Serveretna</i>
has been introduced to the family of <i>Santa</i>
and her sisters.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Although the musical art of the Hindoos had
such an early existence, it seems not to have developed
or receded much since ancient days; they
possess airs to which the European ear instantly,
and involuntarily attaches harmony, (auxiliary
voices), and yet they have not the slightest craving
for harmony. They are completely satisfied
to express all emotion by melody, sometimes
combined with the dance, and yet do not feel the
monotony, which would be obviated by additional
voices.</p>
<p>But it must be said that, so far as melody goes,
they have great taste and discrimination; the music
often approaches the European in form and
rhythm, and the Hindoo seems to feel instinctively
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the importance of the tonic, and dominant, and
often finishes the phrases of a melody with a
half cadence.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Of the Hindoo instruments the Vina takes the
lead; as before mentioned, they ascribe to it a
divine origin; it has four strings and is incorrectly
defined as a lyre by many commentators, but it is
rather a guitar than lyre, and is made of a large
hollow bamboo pipe, about 3&frac12; feet long, at
each end of which are two large hollow gourds, to
increase the resonance: it may be roughly compared
to a drum major&rsquo;s <i>baton</i>, with a ball at
<i>both</i> ends, while the strings extend along the stick;
it has a finger-board like a guitar, and the frets
are not fastened permanently on it, but stuck on
by the performer with wax.</p>
<p>The tone is both full and delicate, sometimes
metallic and clear and very pleasant. The music
composed for it is usually brilliant and rapid, and
the Hindoos seem to have their Liszts and Rubinsteins;
in the last century Djivan Shah was known
throughout all India as a <i>virtuoso</i>, on the Vina.</p>
<p>They ornament their Vinas sometimes very richly
and there are paintings of their chief performers,
sitting with magnificent Vinas leaning against
their bodies, this being the attitude of the player.
They also have possessed from time immemorial,
a three-stringed violin, so that Raphael and Tintoretto
may not have committed an anachronism
in painting Apollo with a violin.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>A Guitar called Magoudi, finishes the list of
characteristic stringed instruments.</p>
<p>The instruments of percussion and wind instruments
are more numerous. They possess four
kinds of drums, and their popular, secular dances
are usually accompanied by the Vina, for the
melody, and drums, bells and cymbals.</p>
<p>Flutes they have possessed from remotest antiquity,
and a muffled drum called Tare for funeral
occasions, and they also have a double flute
with a single mouth piece. We will not dwell
further upon their instruments; there is but one,
the <i>Vina</i>, which is really fitted to produce beautiful
music.</p>
<p>The Hindoos complain that their old music is
deteriorating and such singers as Chanan or
Dhilcook, two vocal celebrities of the last centuries,
have passed away. When one inquires
for the miracle-working Ragas, (improvised songs)
in Bengal, the people say there are singers probably
left in Cashmere who can give them; and
should you inquire in Cashmere they would send
you to Bengal for them, but in reality there seems
to have been comparatively little change in the
style of Hindoo music from its earliest days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.</h2>
<p>The ancient Egyptians ascribed the origin of
music to opposite causes, some legends giving
its invention to beneficent Deities, while other
legends are interpreted to give its origin to Satan,
the evil principle, or at least the principle of sensuality,
as represented by the buck Mendes.
Hermes (or Mercury) is accredited with first having
observed the harmony of the spheres, and the
lyre also is represented as being his invention, in
the following legend:</p>
<p>A heavy inundation of the Nile had taken
place, and when the waters receded, there was
left upon the banks a tortoise, who went the way
of all tortoises, and after a time was completely
dried up by the sun; the tendons however, which
were attached to the shell, remained, and became
tightly drawn by the expansion of the shell.
Hermes, wandering upon the bank, accidentally
struck his foot against it; the tendons resounded,
and Hermes thus found a natural lyre.</p>
<p>This legend is however found also in Hindoo
and Greek Mythology, and may be one of those
tales, springing from Arian root, which belong to
almost every race. We also find an Egyptian
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Apollo and Muses in other musical legends, according
to Diodorus Siculus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Osiris was in Ethiopia,&mdash;the Egyptian
God Osiris was a sort of blending of Bacchus and
Apollo&mdash;he met a troupe of revelling satyrs, and
being a lover of pleasure and taking delight in
choruses of music, he admitted them to his already
numerous train of musicians. In the midst of
these satyrs were nine young maidens, skilled in
music and divers sciences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Egyptians also considered Horus, brother
of Osiris, (equivalent to the Greek Apollo) as God
of Harmony.</p>
<p>Thus three Gods have the honor of fostering
Egyptian music, Osiris, Horus, and Hermes.</p>
<p>Hermes, or (by his Egyptian name) Thoth, was
the especial God of many sciences, and is said to
have written two books of song, or works relating
to the song-art. According to Diodorus, the Lyre
which he had invented had three strings, which
represented the three seasons of Egypt; the deepest
string was the wet season, the middle one the
growing season, the highest the harvest season:
the tones of Egyptian music seem to be taken
from the seven heavenly planets, as known to the
ancients, and from this circumstance Ambros
hazards the conjecture that the diatonic scale was
known to them.</p>
<p>Among the mythical musical personages of the
earliest Egyptian music, may be mentioned Maneros,
who was son of the first king of Egypt, who
succeeded the second dynasty of demi-gods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>He seems to be analogous to the Linus, (son of
Apollo), of the Greeks; he died young, and the
<i>first</i> song of the Egyptian music<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> was in his
honor; it was a lament over his untimely end, the
swift passing away of Youth, Spring, etc. The
song was sung under various guises, for Maneros,
Linus, Adonis, etc., among various ancient
nations, and Herodotus was surprised at hearing
it in Egypt. But in course of time the song itself,
and not the king&rsquo;s son was called Maneros, and
gradually diffused its influence, (the warning
of the passing away of Joy) through Egyptian
social life; at their banquets a perfectly painted
statue of a <i>corpse</i> was borne round and shown to
each guest, and there was sung the following
warning:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Cast your eyes upon this corpse</p>
<p class="t0">You will be like this after Death,</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore drink and be merry now.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The song also from being a mournful one,
became in time joyous and lively,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> Plutarch
thinks that the words Maneros, became synonymous
with &ldquo;Good Health.&rdquo; The fashion was
after the conquest of Egypt, imitated in Rome.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
The ancient Egyptian music was really a twofold
affair and is well symbolized in being attributed
by some to good, by others to evil gods; for it
was used in the religious services of the highest
gods, (except, according to Strabo, in the services
of Osiris, at Abydos) and on the other hand was
degraded as a pastime for the lowest orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The musicians were not held in any respect,
and were not allowed to change their occupation,
but were obliged to transmit it from father to son
and were also probably compelled to live in a certain
quarter of the cities wherein they dwelt.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Of course there were celebrated singers and
performers, and also leaders of the chants, and
royal singers, who were exceptions to the foregoing
rule, but according to Diodorus Siculus, the
Egyptians not only considered music a useless art,
but even a hurtful one, as it enervated the soul
and made man effeminate. Yet for all this
there are found among ancient sculptures many
representations of singers and musicians evidently
belonging to the higher classes, though we cannot
but believe that these exceptions only prove the
rule, and even to-day music is considered a sensuous
and rather unmanly art, by Eastern nations.</p>
<p>Among the most ancient songs of Egypt there
seem to have been little refrains sung by the working
classes while at labor; there is here not conjecture
but absolute certainty, for the words of
part of one of these songs are preserved, on an
ancient picture of threshers of grain, oxen, etc.;
the threshers sing, according to Champollion&rsquo;s
learned deciphering,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thresh for yourselves, oh oxen,</p>

</div>
<p>In a grotto at <i>El bersheh</i> there is also a painting
of the transportation of a colossal statue from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
quarry, and here also while one hundred and seventy-two
men are laboring at the ropes, one is
perched upon the statue and is giving the time of
a refrain, which all are to sing.</p>
<p>The custom of singing while at work still exists
in Egypt, as, for example, sailors sing a particular
song when starting on a voyage, another when
there is danger of a collision, another when the
danger is past.</p>
<p>Music was a chief portion of the Egyptian funeral
ceremonies, and on the walls of nearly all
the tombs of ancient days, are found paintings of
the funeral ceremonies; the greater part of what
is known of their instruments comes from this
source; the best singers and players were engaged
for the purpose by the richer classes, and
sang mournful chants, being similar to the professional
mourners at present found in the East.
The music was probably chiefly melodic, or one-voiced,
though this subject has some ambiguity
attached to it, our only guide as to their music
being the representations in the tombs, etc., as not
a scrap of actual music has been left to us; but
when we consider the furious controversy about,
and the different interpretations of the fragments
of Greek music which time has left us, this may
be an <i>advantage</i> rather than otherwise. There
is one painting<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> left, which seems to confirm the
idea that the Egyptians knew something of the
effect of harmony. This painting represents two
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
harpers at one side and three flute players at the
other, while between them are two singers, one of
whom seems to be following with his voice the
melody of the harpers, while the other sings with
the flutes; this seems to intimate that the Egyptians
possessed, at least <i>two-voiced</i> harmony.</p>
<p>Chappell, in his admirable History of Music,
says that it is mathematically impossible, that all
of the instruments represented in their paintings
should have been played in unison.</p>
<p>The music of Egypt was for a long time regulated
by the Government, that is all innovations
were punishable by law; probably this referred
only to religious music, and did not affect popular
music.</p>
<p>In all ages there seem to have been two distinct
schools of music, the scientific, and popular.
There is no doubt that while the early European
theorists held that <i>only consecutive fifths and
fourths</i> were musical, the populace had a less
forced and more beautiful style, and it is more
than probable that in Egypt the popular music
was totally different from the sacred.</p>
<p>All the songs appear to have been accompanied
by a clapping of hands, and therefore the rhythm
was probably strongly marked. The effect of this
clapping of hands is by no means unpleasant, and
is still used by the negroes of America in some
songs and dances, and among various barbarous
nations. It seems curious to think, that in witnessing
these lively dances, one may be beholding
a counterpart of the enjoyments of four thousand
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
years ago, or that in witnessing the <i>pirouettes</i>
of a ballet dancer, we are amusing ourselves in
the ancient Egyptian manner; the latter fact is
proved by ancient paintings, however. Other
ancient Egyptian dances were similar to the modern
jigs, clog dances and breakdowns, as is amply
shown by figures found both in Upper and
Lower Egypt.</p>
<p>The Egyptians had also dances with regular
figures, forward and back, swing, etc.; these dances
were restricted to the lower orders, the upper
classes being forbidden to indulge in them.</p>
<p>If we could transport ourselves back to Thebes
in its days of grandeur, we should be somewhat
astonished at the slight change, in comparison
with what is usually supposed, from our own
times. Imagine the time of a great religious festival.
The Nile is crowded with boats, loaded to
their utmost capacity, with passengers, offerings,
etc. Sometimes hundreds of thousands came to
Thebes or Memphis, and especially to Bubastis,
on such occasions. From each boat is heard
playing and singing. Within the city all the
streets are full; here march by a troop of Pharaoh&rsquo;s
soldiers, all the privates uniformed alike,
their marching regular, and their drill well
attended to; at their head is a military band,
(picture found at Thebes) of trumpeters, drummers
beating the drum with their <i>hands</i>, and
other performers; along that mighty avenue of
Sphinxes is marching a procession to one of the
temples: here also musical instruments, particularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
flutes, head the column, and a processional
hymn is being sung, to which the white-robed
priests keep time while marching, as they carry
the sacred golden barge of the God, full of treasure
of various kinds.</p>
<p>Here is passing along, a deputation from some
far off tributary prince in the heart of &AElig;thiopia,
carrying presents for the king, and all around is
life, bustle, and enjoyment. In some of the temples
music is sounding, (the temple of Osiris, at
Abydos, being the only exception,) and the clang
of the sistrum is often heard. Truly the life of
ancient Egypt was as joyous and varied as that of
more modern times.</p>
<p>The sistrum was, until the Napoleonic expedition
to Egypt, which gave to the world the wonders
of this store house of antiquity, considered the
representative of Egyptian music. It was merely
a short, oval hand frame which held three or four
metal bars; sometimes bells were hung upon these
bars, and by shaking the instrument, as a baby
shakes a rattle, which it really in principle
resembles, a jingling of the bars or bells was
produced.</p>
<p>Latterly it has been thought that the sistrum
was not a musical instrument at all; but, like
the bell sounded at the elevation of the Host
in Catholic churches, was used as a means of
riveting and impressing the minds of the worshippers.
At all events the sistrum takes no rank
among Egyptian musical instruments. The harp
was really the instrument on which they lavished
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
the most attention; paintings, and fragments of
harps have been found, in the so-called &ldquo;Harpers&rsquo;
Tomb,&rdquo; which caused Bruce to exclaim that no
modern maker could manufacture a more beautiful
piece of workmanship.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptian harps look very modern
indeed, except for the fact that they have no front
board or &ldquo;Pole,&rdquo; and it seems strange that they
could bear the tension without its support; the
pitch could not have been at all high. There
was a species of harp, of the compass of about
two octaves, with catgut strings, (wire strings the
Egyptians had not), found in a tomb hewn in the
solid rock at Thebes, so entirely preserved that it
was played upon by the discoverer, and gave out
its tones <i>after being buried 3000 years</i>. Of course
the strings perished after exposure to the air.</p>
<p>Fetis, to whom musical history owes so much,
has here fallen into a singular mistake. He says
&ldquo;it would scarcely be believed that the ancient
Egyptians with whom the cat was a sacred animal,
should have used <i>cat-gut</i> strings on their instruments,
but the fact is proved beyond a doubt.&rdquo;
This is all very true, but M. Fetis seems not to
have known the fact that cat-gut has not its origin
in the <i>cat</i>, but is almost always, in reality <i>sheep-gut</i>.</p>
<p>The list of instruments of ancient Egypt embraces
harps of various numbers of strings, Nabla,
from which come the Roman <i>Nablium</i> and Hebrew
<i>Nebel</i>, a sort of Guitar; Flutes, single and
double, (a flute player often headed the sacred
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
processions, and Isis is said to have invented the
flute.) Tambourines and hand drums; sometimes
the Egyptians danced to a rhythmic accompaniment
of these alone.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> The flute was generally
played by men, and the tambourines by women.
Lyres, of various shapes, often played with the
hand, but sometimes also with a plectrum, (a short,
black stick, with which the strings were struck,)
trumpets, cymbals, and some metal instruments of
percussion. There are many paintings in which
entire orchestras of these instruments are playing
together, but probably all in unison.</p>
<p>There exists an excellent painting from a Theban
tomb,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> in which we see an Egyptian musical party
in a private house. Two principal figures are
smelling of small nosegays, while two females
offer to them refreshments; three females are
dancing and singing for the amusement of the
guests, who sit around, apparently having a very
enjoyable time; below are seen slaves preparing
a banquet, which is to follow the music. The
Egyptians often had music before dinner.</p>
<p>Another application of music is pictured in a very
ancient painting, given by Rosellini,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> in his great
work; in it is seen a woman nursing an infant,
while a harper and singer are furnishing music,
possibly to lull the child to sleep; in almost all
these paintings the singers are represented with
one hand to their ear in order to catch the pitch
of the instruments more readily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>But the most interesting painting has been
copied, in the folios of Lepsius,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> from a tomb of
great antiquity; it represents a course of <i>musical
instruction</i> in the department of the singers and
players of King Amenhotep <span class="smaller">IV.</span> (18th Dynasty).
We see several large and small rooms, connecting
with each other; furniture, musical instruments
and implements are seen all around, especially in
the small rooms or closets. In the large rooms
are the musicians, engaged in practising and
teaching; one teacher is sitting, listening to the
singing of a young girl, while another pupil
is accompanying her on the harp; another girl
stands attentively listening to the teacher&rsquo;s instructions,
(<i>class system</i> evidently); in another
part two girls are practising a dance, while a harper
accompanies; other musicians are variously
engaged. In one room is a young lady having
her hair dressed, and in another, a young
miss has leant her harp against the wall, and is
sitting down with a companion to lunch. This
certainly gives a fair insight into the music life of
old, and we leave Egyptian music, of which <i>as
music</i> we know nothing, with more satisfaction
after this glance at the <i>Royal Egyptian Conservatory
of Music</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />BIBLICAL AND HEBREW.</h2>
<p>The earliest scriptural mention of music is in
Genesis, Chapter <span class="smaller">IV.</span> where Jubal is spoken of as
&ldquo;Father of those who handle the harp and organ.&rdquo;
But harp and organ must by no means be confounded
with our modern instruments of the same name.
The harp was probably an instrument of three
strings, while all the very ancient references to
an organ, simply mean a &ldquo;Syrinx&rdquo; or Pan&rsquo;s pipes.
The music of Biblical History is, as is almost all
the music of ancient nations, combined to a
great extent with the dance; the dances of the
ancients were what to-day would be called pantomimes,
expressing joy, sorrow, fear, or anger,
by the motions and expressions of face and
body, rather than by the feet.</p>
<p>The real character of the ancient Hebrew music,
as well as of many of the musical instruments,
is involved in utter obscurity, and no clues to
enlighten the investigator, remain in the modern
music of this usually most conservative of peoples;
much of their musical system was borrowed, until
David&rsquo;s time certainly, from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>The music of the modern Jews is tinged in
almost every instance with the character of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
music of the people around them; thus the same
psalms are sung in a different manner by German,
Polish, Spanish, or Portuguese Jews.</p>
<p>One little trace of their primitive music remains;
on the occasion of their New Year, a ram&rsquo;s horn
is blown, and between the blasts on this excruciating
instrument the following phrases are addressed
to the performer,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Tahkee-oo, Schivoorim, Taru-o.</i></p>
</div>
<p>These words, which also have a reverential meaning,
may possibly at one time have been addressed
to the ancient musicians, to give to them the order
of the music. Strong presumptive proof that this
blowing of the trumpet is the same as it was in
King David&rsquo;s time is found in the fact that it is
blown in the same rhythm, by the Jews <i>all over
the world</i>. It certainly requires no forced interpretation
to call the Ram&rsquo;s horn (Schofer) one of their
early instruments, as it would be their most
natural signal-call both in peace and war.</p>
<p>In all the Jewish theocracy, the music naturally
took a theosophical character, and is seldom
detached from religious rites; we shall find the
same spirit running through other of the ancient
civilizations, even barbarians seeming to share in
the almost universal impulse to praise the Deity
with this art, and this should prove to supercilious
critics that however ill-sounding the music of other
races may appear to our ears, to <i>them</i> it was a
highly considered art, and as such, merits our
attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>David may be regarded as the real founder of
Hebrew music. He must have possessed great
skill even in his youth, as the instance of his being
able to soothe Saul&rsquo;s crazed mind with his music,
proves. This may be regarded as one of the earliest
notices of the effects of music in mental disease.
What the nature of his inventions and reforms in
music afterwards were, and how far he remodelled
the style which had been brought from Egypt,
cannot now be known, as Jerusalem has been pillaged
nearly twenty times since his reign, and
every monument, or inscription which might solve
the enigma, has long been destroyed.</p>
<p>There are still marks and inflections in the Hebrew
Scriptures which are evidently intended to
show the style in which they were to be chanted.</p>
<p>Regarding the instruments spoken of in Scripture
as being used in the Temple there is also
no certainty. In the Talmud there is mention of
an organ which had but ten pipes, yet gave one
hundred different tones; this instrument is placed
about the beginning of the Christian Era, and is
called <i>Magrepha</i>; it is said of it, that its tones
were so powerful that when it was played, the
people in Jerusalem could not hear each other
talk. Pfeiffer conjectures that it was probably not
an organ, but a very loud drum. There are other
authorities who have endeavored to prove that the
<i>Magrepha</i> was simply a <i>fire shovel</i>; they contend
that it was used at the sacrifices of the Temple to
build up the fire, and was then thrown down, with
a loud noise, to inform people outside how far the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
services had progressed. The reader has liberty
to make his own choice, for the authorities are
pretty evenly balanced,&mdash;<i>organ</i>, <i>drum</i>, or <i>fire
shovel</i>.</p>
<p>We must make some allowance for Oriental
exaggeration in musical matters, for when
Josephus speaks of a performance by 200,000
singers, 40,000 sistrums, 40,000 harps, and 200,000
trumpets, we must imagine that either Josephus&rsquo;
tale, or the ears of the Hebrews, were tough.
All these statements only enlarge a fruitless field,
for in it all is conjecture.</p>
<p>The flute was a favorite instrument both for joy
and sorrow: the Talmud contains a saying that
&ldquo;flutes are suited either to the bride or to the
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The performance of all these instruments seems
to have been always in unison, and often in the
most <i>fortissimo</i> style.</p>
<p>Calmet gives a list of Hebrew instruments
including viols, trumpets, drums, bells, Pan&rsquo;s
pipes, flutes, cymbals, etc., and it is possible that
these have existed among them in a primitive
form.</p>
<p>The abb&eacute; de la Molette gives the number of the
chief Jewish instruments as twelve, and states
that they borrowed three newer ones from the
Chaldeans, during the Babylonian captivity.</p>
<p>According to records of the Rabbins, given by
Forkel, the Jews possessed in David&rsquo;s time,
thirty-six instruments.</p>
<p>Some of the instruments named in the Scriptures
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
are as follows:&mdash;<i>Kinnor</i>, usually mentioned in
the English translation as a harp, so often alluded
to in the Psalms, (&ldquo;Praise the Lord with harp,&rdquo;
etc., xxxiii:2,) was probably a lyre, or a small
harp, of triangular shape: that the Hebrews possessed
a larger harp is more than probable, for
they were in communication with Assyria and
Egypt, where the harp, in a highly developed state,
was the national instrument, but it is a matter
of much dispute, as to which of the musical terms
used in the Scriptures was intended to apply to
this larger harp.</p>
<p>The <i>Nebel</i>, or <i>Psaltery</i>, was a species of Dulcimer.</p>
<p>The <i>Asor</i>;&mdash;When David sang of an &ldquo;instrument
of ten strings,&rdquo; he referred to the asor, which
is supposed to have been a species of lyre, with
ten strings, and played with a <i>plectrum</i>, a short
stick of wood, or bone, usually black, with which
the strings were struck.</p>
<p>The <i>Timbrel</i> or <i>Taboret</i>, was a small hand drum,
or tambourine, probably of varying shapes and
sizes; the hand drum was derived from Egypt, for
it was customary for women to dance in that
country entirely to the rhythm of drums and
tambourines; the military hand drum had the
shape of a small keg with parchment over the
ends; that is to say, the diameter at the middle
was greatest.</p>
<p><i>The Organ</i>;&mdash;as before stated this was simply a
set of pandean pipes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p><i>Cymbals</i>;&mdash;there seems to be no doubt that the
Hebrews possessed various instruments of percussion
of divers shapes.</p>
<p><i>Trumpets</i>;&mdash;apart from the ram&rsquo;s horn, and other
curved horns which were called trumpets, there
also existed a straight trumpet of more artificial
construction. &ldquo;Make thee, two trumpets of silver:
of one piece shalt thou make them.&rdquo; Numbers ix:2.</p>
<p>It is probable that the sistrum, the guitar, and
pipes, were also possessed by this nation; about
nineteen instruments are mentioned in the scriptures,
but some of the meanings are so dubious
that they have been translated by the general
terms, harp, lute, psaltery, timbrel, etc.</p>
<p>How many different opinions are held, upon
Hebrew music may be judged from the fact that
the word &ldquo;<i>Selah</i>,&rdquo; which was probably a musical
term, and is found in so many of the psalms,
has given rise to the most vehement and fruitless
controversy. Hesychius says that it means a
charge of rhythm, in the chanting; Alberti denies
this, as it sometimes occurs at the end of a psalm,
where certainly no change is possible: some have
suggested that it meant a modulation from one key
to another; Forkel, however, thinks that the Hebrews
were not so far advanced in the science of
music as to understand modulation, but Fetis
upsets Forkel by remarking that the modulations,
though not harmonic, might have been purely
melodic, by the introduction of tones, foreign to
the key, as occurs in many eastern melodies.</p>
<p>Herder says also &ldquo;the Orientals even of our
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
day, love monotonous chants, which Europeans
find doleful, and which at certain passages or
phrases, change totally and abruptly their mode
and time: the word <i>Selah</i> was without doubt an
indication of such a change.&rdquo; The last part of this
opinion, Fetis sets down as pure hypothesis.</p>
<p>Two ancient Greek versions of the Old Testament
give the meaning of the word as &ldquo;forever,&rdquo; and
as &ldquo;for all ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberti thinks the word is a recapitulation of the
chords of the psalm: Rosenm&uuml;ller proves that
this is impossible in some cases.</p>
<p>Augusti thinks it is an expression of joy similar
to &ldquo;Hallelujah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Kimchi thinks it a sign of elevation of
the voice; Mattheson and Pfeiffer agree in the
opinion that it signifies a <i>ritornella</i>, or short symphony
between the verses, to be played by the
instruments alone.</p>
<p>Eichhorn thinks it means <i>Da Capo</i>, but Rosenm&uuml;ller
and Gesenius, (the latter treats the matter
with great erudition, and his opinion is entitled to
respect,) both think that it signifies a rest in the
song part, as we might write <i>Tacet</i>.</p>
<p>Gesenius has found almost the only corroborative
testimony of the whole controversy in the fact
that the grammatical root of the word Selah, is
repose, or silence.</p>
<p>La Borde has boldly, not to say audaciously,
given a unique interpretation. He says &ldquo;David
invented the art of shading the sounds; the word
<i>Selah</i> is equivalent to the Italian word <i>smorzando</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
extinguished, dying away.&rdquo; And then he
gives a highly colored picture of the beauty and
grace of the effects produced, though all that he
proves is that he has a little stronger imagination
than the others. We must also give the curious
opinion of Wolff, who thinks that &ldquo;<i>Selah</i>&rdquo; has no
sense whatever, and was only added to fill up the
metre of a verse.</p>
<p>Several other eminent writers, including Fetis,
who gives a full account of this war of opinions,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
decline to hazard an opinion in so dark a matter.</p>
<p>Another conjectural description of the mode of
singing among the ancient Hebrews, is the
commentary of Herder on the song of Deborah
and Barak, Judges v.; he says, &ldquo;probably verses
1-11 were interrupted by the shouts of the populace;
verses 12-27 were a picture of the battle
with a naming of the leaders with praise or blame,
and mimicking each one as named; verses 28-30
were mockery of the triumph of Sissera, and the
last verse was given as chorus by the whole
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One cannot fail to observe some resemblance
between this music and the slave music of some
sections of the southern states: in the camp-meetings,
and religious services, a tune which is
well known to all is chosen, and as the spirit moves,
often a whole song appropriate to the occasion is
improvised. Of some such description must have
been Miriam&rsquo;s song, after the downfall of Pharaoh&rsquo;s
host; she probably chose a tune which was
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
familiar to the people, and improvised, while the
people kept the rhythm, or sang refrains.</p>
<p>Of course the element of poetry was immeasurably
greater among the Israelites than among
the Negroes, but the similarity of improvisation
and religious fervor is noticeable.</p>
<p>When Miriam sang, there was as yet no
distinctive style of Hebrew music; we must remember
that she had obtained an Egyptian education,
and that up to David&rsquo;s time the music was an
imitation of the Egyptian school.</p>
<p>The raptures of some commentators as to the
exceeding beauty of the music of David, are quite
safe, for it is easy to affirm where no one can bring
rebutting evidence, but if it partook of the loudness
of most ancient and barbarous music,&mdash;&ldquo;Play
skillfully, and with a loud noise,&rdquo; Psalms xxxiii:2&mdash;our
modern music may after all be some compensation
for its utter loss and oblivion.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />ANCIENT GREEK MUSIC.</h2>
<p>The mythology of Greek music is too well
known, for us to go into any details upon the subject;
with this people every thing relating to
music, was ennobled and enriched by an applicable
legend, or a finely conceived poem. In fact
music (mousik&eacute;), meant with the Greeks, all the
&aelig;sthetics, and culture that were used in education
of youth, and the strictly <i>musical</i> part of the above
training had special names, as <i>harmonia</i>, etc., to
designate it.</p>
<p>The subject of Greek music has given rise to
more commentary and dispute, than any other in
the entire realm of musical history.</p>
<p>The mode of notation employed was peculiar;
it consisted in placing the letters of the alphabet
in various positions, straight, sideways, etc., and
sometimes even, fragments of letters were used.</p>
<p>There are in existence but three authentic Greek
hymns<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> with music, viz: hymn to Calliope, to
Apollo, and to Nemesis; there is also in existence,
some music to the first eight verses of the first
Pythian of Pindar, which Athanasius Kircher
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
claimed to have discovered in a monastery near
Messina, but the best authorities reject this as
spurious. The copies of the above hymns are
not older than the fifteenth century, and have
probably been much perverted by the ignorance,
or half-knowledge of the transcribers, who seeing
a fragment of a letter, would restore the whole
letter, or change its position, thereby greatly altering
the character of the music.</p>
<p>To this fact is to be attributed the dense fog,
which has prevented us from fully understanding
the ancient Greek music.</p>
<p>On this slight foundation however, learned
writers have built an edifice of erudition which
consists of countless volumes of pedantry and
ingenuity, mixed with a large amount of abuse for
those who did not agree with their solution.</p>
<p>As we intend to deal, in these articles, more with
curious musical facts than with musical systems,
we will dismiss this branch of the subject entirely
by referring the reader to the best representative
works of this monument of research, which are
Chappell&rsquo;s History of Music, vol. <span class="smaller">I.</span>, Ambros&rsquo;
Geschichte der Musik, vol. <span class="smaller">I.</span>, pp. 218-513, Fetis&rsquo;
Histoire Generale de la Musique, vol. <span class="smaller">III.</span>, pp. 1-418.
Kiesewetter, and Drieberg also have written
profoundly on the subject. These will give the
different opinions held in the matter.</p>
<p>The <i>scale</i> of the Greeks, is however, definitely
known, and was similar to our minor scale, although
it contained no sharp seventh. Play on any
pianoforte the notes, <span class="smaller">A B C D E F G</span>, and you
have played the Greek one octave diatonic scale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The nomenclature was however different, and
some commentators have forgotten to explain the
fact, that what the Greeks called the <i>highest note</i>,
meant the longest string of the instrument, and
consequently the <i>lowest</i> tone.</p>
<p>Another fact which has given rise to much
controversy is the pitch of the lyre or phorminx;
it seems that the mode of tuning this instrument
varied in Greece at different epochs, and even
in different localities at the same epoch.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The word harmony (harmonik&#275;) has also been
misunderstood, as it does not mean harmony in
our sense of the word, but the arrangement and
rhythm of a melody. Whether the Greeks understood
harmony or not, in the modern sense, has
been the chief cause of the before-mentioned
&ldquo;Battle of the Books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lowest note of the scale was called Proslambanomenos,
and had not the importance of the
middle note, called Mese, which really became
the principal note of the scale.</p>
<p>The Greek music practically, was very like our
present minor modes, and the singing of some
young Greek of two thousand years ago, would
probably have sounded pleasantly to modern ears.</p>
<p>The earliest Greek scale had but four tones, and
was probably used to accompany hymns. It
might still suffice for many church chants.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>
People seldom think how much music can be
manufactured from three or four notes; Rousseau
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
gave a practical illustration of it in the last century,
by writing a not very monotonous tune, on
three notes. But an instrument founded on so few
notes might also have been used to give the pitch
to the voice in reciting, or half-singing a poem.
We must remember that the poems of Greece
were chanted in public; and even in modern
days, orators pitch their voices higher than in conversation,
when addressing an assembly.</p>
<p>Early Grecian music experienced its first real
onward movement, when Egypt was thrown open
to foreigners. Up to the reign of Psammetichus
<span class="smaller">I.</span>, (664 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>) Egypt was closed to aliens, exactly
as China has been closed in days not long gone by.
Psammetichus first opened his kingdom to the
Greeks, and Pythagoras learned enough in Egypt
to greatly change the character of Greek music.
Though some Greek writers with an excess of
zeal, have made the statement that he taught the
Egyptians, by bringing to them the seven-stringed
lyre. Considering the fact that the Egyptians had
as many as twenty-two strings, the claim is rather
audacious.</p>
<p>But what placed the Greeks in advance of all
other ancient nations, in music, was the fact that
they early recognized its rank as a <i>fine art</i>.</p>

<br />THE PUBLIC GAMES OF GREECE.</h2>
<p>The public games of Greece in which music
and musical contests were a feature, gave to
the art a decided impetus, for when competition
began, musical study must have preceded.</p>
<p>The Olympic games were celebrated at Olympia
every fifth year, in July, and lasted five days.
They were dedicated to Zeus (Jupiter), and were
established (according to some re-established, having
existed in Mythical ages) by Iphitos, king of
Elis, in the ninth century before the Christian era.</p>
<p>For a long time none but Grecians were allowed
to compete in them. If there existed internal war in
Greece at the time, an armistice was effected during
the games. The contestants were trained for ten
months previous to the contest. The prizes
awarded to the victors were wreaths of wild olive
twigs, cut from a sacred tree which grew in the
consecrated grove of Olympia, and the victors
were presented to the spectators, while a herald
proclaimed the name of each, his father, and his
country.</p>
<p>The first day opened with a sacrifice to Zeus,
after which a contest of trumpeters took place.
This contest was not regularly instituted until 396
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
<span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, but after that period it was not interrupted.
There are still annals left of the most celebrated
contestants; Archias of Hybla, gained the prize
for three successive Olympiads; and Athen&aelig;us
says that Herodorus of Megara, a most famous
trumpeter, gained the prize <i>ten times in succession</i>.
Pollux says he gained <i>seventeen</i> victories, which
is well-nigh incredible, but both agree in saying
that this remarkable performer was in one year
crowned in the four great sacred games, the
Olympian, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian. His
music was so loud that the audience were sometimes
stunned by the concussion. Other anecdotes
of this wonderful trumpeter remain. He
was of giant stature, and slept upon a bear skin,
in imitation of Hercules and the lion skin. He
could play upon two trumpets at the same time,
and when he did so, the audience had to sit farther
away than usual, on account of the immense
sound. His performances were of great use in
military affairs. Once at the siege of Argos, the
troops were giving way when Herodorus began to
sound his two trumpets, which so inspired the
warriors of Demetrius, that they returned to the
fight and won the victory.</p>
<p>The trumpet cannot really be classed among
Grecian musical instruments, as it was rather a
signal than any thing else. It was blown when
heralds made any proclamation, in military movements,
etc., and seems to have been appreciated
only by the loudness with which it was blown.</p>
<p>It was also frequently played at the Olympic
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
games during the horse-races, to inspirit the
animals.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>In fact at the public games the music had a
most noisy character, and trumpeters were proud
of bursting a blood vessel, or otherwise injuring
themselves by excess of zeal.</p>
<p>The contest of trumpeters was the only musical
(?) one of these games, though flute-playing
took place on the fourth day, when according to
Krause,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> the <i>pentathlon</i> took place. This was a
set of five athletic games; leaping, running, throwing
spear, throwing <i>discus</i>, and wrestling. Here
flute-playing also served to animate the contestants.
The flutes too, considering the purpose for
which they were used, must have been played in a
violent manner.</p>
<p>Harmonides, a young flute-player, on his first
appearance at the games wishing to <i>astonish</i> the
audience, began by giving such a tremendous blast
on his instrument, that he expired on the spot,
probably having burst a blood vessel, and having
literally blown himself out with his first note.
The audience was probably astonished.</p>
<p>The sacred games next in importance, were the
Pythian. These games were at first celebrated by
the Delphians, every ninth year, but about 590
<span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, the Amphyctions (another Grecian tribe)
obtained the control of them, and instituted them
every fifth year. They took place on a plain near
Delphi, and were in honor of Apollo, commemorating
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
his victory over the serpent Python; the good
principle defeating the evil principle, as in Egyptian,
and most other mythologies. Pindar&rsquo;s odes
have celebrated the victories at some of these
games. Being dedicated to Apollo, it was but
natural that music, (under this head, the Greeks
understood most of the accomplishments of the
muses,) should play the most important part.</p>
<p>Religious poems were chanted, with an accompaniment
upon the lyre or phorminx. The first
poet-musicians who gained the prize were Chrysothemis,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
Philammon, an earlier poet-musician
than Homer, and Thamyris. According to
Pausanius, all these singers were probably priests
of Apollo. The Amphyctions first established
prizes for songs with flute accompaniment, and
for flute <i>solos</i>. Cephallon obtained a prize for
songs accompanied by Kithara, a small lyre, and
Echembrotus one for songs with flute, while
Sacadas of Argos took the prize three consecutive
times for his flute solos. After him came
Pythocritus of Sicyon, who won the prize at these
games six consecutive times, which covers an
interval of <i>thirty years</i> of triumphs.</p>
<p>Athletic sports also were introduced later. The
prizes were, as at Olympia, wreaths only.</p>
<p>The use of the flute both as solo instrument,
and as accompaniment, was however, soon abolished,
it being used as funeral music, and for dirge
playing among the Amphyctions, and therefore
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
having too many melancholy associations to
allow of its use in these festive games. Finally
<i>solos</i> on the small lyre (kithara) were allowed
prizes.</p>
<p>It is said that at one of these contests a flute
player gained the prize in a singular manner.
He was playing the straight flute, when the
reed in the mouth-piece became closed by
accident, on which he instantly changed the
position of his instrument, and played it as an
<i>oblique</i> flute; his presence of mind was rewarded,
by winning the prize.</p>
<p>The Nemean games were commemorative of the
slaying of the Nemean lion, by Hercules. There
was no musical contest in the games, but flutes
were used, to stimulate the athletes, and were
probably allowed prizes.</p>
<p>The Isthmian games celebrated upon the Isthmus
of Corinth, whence their name, were similar
to the Nemean; music not being of any importance
in them.</p>
<p>In Chios there has been found a stone on which
the names of the victors in the musical contests
are inscribed. From it we learn that prizes were
given for reading music at sight, rhapsodizing,
accompanying the voice with a small harp played
with the hand, and accompanying with kithara
played partially with the fingers of the left hand,
and partially with a <i>plectrum</i> held in the right hand.</p>
<p>The lesser games of Greece were also not
inconsiderable. The great festival of Athens was
the Panathen&aelig;a, held in honor of Athene the
patron goddess of the city. It was established
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
according to tradition, about 1521 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, and was at
first intended for the citizens of Athens only. It
took place about the middle of July.</p>
<p>At the later Panathen&aelig;a, the people of all Attica
used to attend. There seem to have been two
divisions of this festival, a greater and lesser
Panathen&aelig;a, the former being celebrated every
four years, the latter every year. The lesser
Panathen&aelig;a consisted of recitations, gymnastics,
musical competitions, and a torch race in the
evening, the whole concluding with the sacrifice
of an ox. The greater, was even more extensive.
The Homeric poems were sung, dramatic representation
took place, magnificient processions
marched to the temple of Athene Polias, and the
whole city was full of mirth and gayety. The
prizes were jars of oil made from the sacred tree
on the Acropolis.</p>
<p>Pericles, (fifth century <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>,) gave to music a
greater prominence than ever before in these
games, by erecting a structure especially for musical
entertainments and contests, the Odeum, in
the street of the Tripod; this edifice was very
well adapted in its acoustical properties, for
according to Plutarch&rsquo;s description, the roof was
dome-shaped, or nearly so, and vast audiences
could hear solos distinctly.</p>
<p>In Sparta, in the month of August (Carneios)
there were celebrated the great Carneian
games, which lasted nine days. In these games
musical contests also took place, and dances of
men, youths, and maidens, as well as gymnastic
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
exercises. Sparta also had a special building for
musical purposes. Theodore of Samos erected
the Skias, a building for musical uses, in the
market place. Sparta was in fact, the cradle of
Grecian music.</p>
<p>In the early days, songs were learned and
transmitted down, from mouth to mouth. Homer&rsquo;s
poems were preserved in this manner for five
hundred years. In Sparta however, they first
began to crystallize into form and regularity.
Yet strange to say, Sparta gave birth to no musicians
of eminence, even though she was so long
the arbiter, and director of Grecian musical taste.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Terpander of Lesbos, one of the founders of
Greek music, came early to Sparta. He is reported
to have gained the prize at the first musical contest
of the Carneian games, <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> 676, and is said to
have studied in Egypt, but he certainly could not
have done so before his first advent in Sparta, for
Egypt was at that date still closed to foreigners,
and had even guards set to prevent the landing of
strangers by the sea.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Terpander gained the Pythian crown four times
in succession, and was the most famous poet-musician
of his time. His fame spread through
all Greece, but it was especially in Sparta that he
won renown, for his high, manly and earnest strains
awoke a sturdy and manly response in the bosoms
of the rugged Spartans. It is probable however
that at the first visit to Sparta, his songs were not
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
so powerful. At that time, (676 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>) he probably
sang chiefly the poems of Homer. We say <i>sang</i>,
but it is not even sure that they had, what we
should call a tune, attached to them; they were
possibly recited in a musical pitch of voice, which
could not be called even a chant.</p>
<p>There was at this time, little music among the
Spartans, and that of rather martial, or else of
religious character; as for example we learn that
the Spartans marched into battle to the sound of
many kitharas, as did also the Cretans, and it was
supposed to have been in honor of the Gods, that
they did so; though Thucydides, more practically,
says that it was only that they might move forward
regularly and in time. On Terpander&rsquo;s second
visit to Sparta, he changed the entire mode of
Spartan music, and enlarged it. The return
happened in this wise:&mdash;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second Messenian war
Sparta was in great perplexity. Messenia by
alliances with other tribes threatened destruction
from without. Within all was dissension; agriculture
prostrate, antagonism between those who
had lost their lands through the wars and those
who possessed them, a demand for a new distribution
of land, and prospective anarchy. At this
juncture, the Oracle of Delphi was consulted, and
gave reply that &ldquo;discord would be quelled in
Sparta when the sound of Terpander&rsquo;s harp was
heard there,&rdquo; and told the Spartans, also to call
the counsellor from Athens. So Terpander was
sent for, and also the counsellor Tyrtaeus from
Athens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The effect of Terpander&rsquo;s songs upon the populace
on this occasion is described as something
remarkable; men burst into tears, enemies embraced
each other, and all internal dissension was
at an end.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>It is recorded therefore, that Terpander with
his harp had quelled all dissension in Sparta, but
by this anecdote we may see that in what the
ancient Greeks called music, the words really
played the most important part. To show this yet
more clearly, we will here give an instance from
later Athenian history where the same power was
exerted for a similar purpose. A war between
Athens and Megara, for the possession of the
island of Salamis, had resulted in such continued
disaster to Athens, that the Athenians had left
the island to its fate, and it was forbidden upon
penalty of death to broach the subject to the public
again. Solon however, attired himself as a
messenger from the island to the Athenians, and
in this character sang a song which roused such a
martial spirit, that on the instant a large body of
volunteers was formed, who, under Solon, effected
its reconquest.</p>
<p>Terpander and Tyrt&aelig;us composed most of their
songs in march rhythm, and after this the Spartans
sang hymns, while marching into battle to
the sound of many kitharas, which were afterwards
displaced by the more penetrating flute.</p>
<p>Terpander also composed love songs, and
banquet songs as well as nomes or hymns, and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
choruses were sung at all Spartan festivals and
sacrifices, they were taught to Spartan youths and
maidens, and all seemed to vie in doing him
honor. He had really helped the music of Greece
to a higher plane, for it is said that he enlarged
the lyre or phorminx from four strings, to seven,
and also made improvements in the scale.</p>
<p>Contemporary with this poet-musician was
Olympus, who must not however be confounded
with an Olympus who lived six hundred years
previously, that is, about 1250 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> Plato says
that the music of Olympus was especially adapted
to animate the hearers. Plutarch says that it
surpassed in simplicity and effect, all other music.
He is said to have composed the air which caused
Alexander to seize his arms, when it was sung
to him; according to Aristotle his music filled
all hearers with enthusiasm. Much relating to
Olympus must however be relegated to the land
of myths. It has even been doubted whether
he ever really existed, though that is carrying
scepticism too far.</p>
<p>Among the other characters which existed on
the borderland of Greek musical history, may be
mentioned Polynestos, and Alcman who brought
to Sparta in its full glow, the love song, (Lydian
measure). Alcman seems to have been easily
aroused to sing of female beauty, and composed
some choruses especially for the</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Honey-voiced, lovely singing maidens,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>which were sung by female voices only.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The fragments which remain of Alcman&rsquo;s
verses do not justify the immense fame which he
seems to have enjoyed in Greece. Alcman was
preceded by Thaletas of Crete, who was sent
for by the Spartans 620 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> to sing to the Gods,
in order that Sparta might be freed from a severe
plague, which was then ravaging the state. The
plague ceased, and Thaletas for a time stood at
the head of all Spartan music. That country as
above mentioned, either would not, or could not
encourage home talent.</p>
<p>Sacadas of Argos came soon after with a yet
more luxurious style, and introduced the flute as
an accompaniment to chorus music.</p>
<p>To this foggy period of history, also belongs
Tisias of Himera, who made an indelible impression
on Greek music. He was the first who regulated
the motions of the chorus, and who reduced
chorus singing to a settled system; from the fact
that at one period of the song, (the <i>epode</i>, or
<i>finale</i>) he made the chorus stand quiet, instead of
dancing he received the nickname of &ldquo;Stesichorus.&rdquo;
In some of the works of Stesichorus, one
can easily see the germ of the choruses of &AElig;schylus
or Sophocles.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>If in the ancient Grecian music, the composer,
poet, and performer seem to be spoken of in
common, the reader must recollect that in those
days, <i>all three</i> branches of the art were united in
one individual. It will also aid some readers, if
we define here what the functions of the Greek
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
chorus were. In the earliest days, the whole
chorus simply sang refrains after the solo of
some cultivated singer; gradually whole compositions
were entrusted to their charge. Pantomimic
action probably always existed in connection with
their songs, as with almost all ancient singing.
Stesichorus first gave them different historical or
mythological subjects to act, in a dramatic manner.
At a later epoch the chorus entered in a
peculiar manner into the action of the drama.
They stood upon the stage as interested spectators
of the various events; they advised the Protagonist
or only individual character<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> as to his course
of action, and when some startling incident, a
murder for example, had taken place, they would
strongly express their feelings, horror, dismay or
fear, and thereby intensify the effect upon the
audience.</p>
<p>An imitation of the Greek chorus may be found
in Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bride of Messina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stesichorus was deservedly honored as the
founder of Greek chorus music, and a statue was
erected to his memory. Among those next following
his era we find Ibycus, a poet-musician
attached to the court of Polycrates, tyrant of
Samos. This mighty sea king and despot had a
considerable liking for music; for we learn also
that he kept a choir of beautiful boys, whose duty
it was to sing sweet Lydian melodies during his
meals. About 580-70 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> Alc&aelig;us and Sappho
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
became leaders in Grecian musical culture, or
poetry, for the two are inseparable. The two
poets seem to have formed a mutual friendship.
Of Sappho we have remaining an ode to Aphrodite
which makes it a matter of regret that the remains
of her poetry are so fragmentary.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> At Mytilene
she seems to have gathered around her a large and
elegant circle, composed entirely of females to
whom she taught poetry and music; in fact her
house must have been a musical university for
her list of scholars embraces names from all
parts of Greece. Ottfried M&uuml;ller<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> compares her
life, surrounded by all these fair followers, with
that of Socrates surrounded by the flower of
Athenian youth.</p>
<p>Sappho&rsquo;s career is the more wonderful from the
fact, that among the ancient Greeks, the entire
mission of woman was supposed to consist in
rearing her family, attending to the first education
of her sons, who at an early age passed into the
hands of their teachers, teaching housewife&rsquo;s
duties to her daughters, and attending to them
herself; according to Pericles, that woman was
most to be prized of whom no one spoke, either
in praise or blame.</p>
<p>Sappho&rsquo;s poetry had great effect even on the
rough character of Solon, the law giver; hearing
for the first time one of her songs, which his
nephew sang to him, he vehemently expressed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
wish that he might not die before he had committed
to memory so beautiful a song.</p>
<p>Sappho&rsquo;s name is almost the only female one in
the whole realm of ancient Greek music, which
was pure, noble, and uncontaminated. Latterly,
even her character has been assailed, but the
accusation has been refuted by Herr Welcker, of
Bonn, (in the <i>Rheinisches Museum</i>,) Ottfried M&uuml;ller
and other learned writers. After her, music as
practiced by the female sex, was handed over to
the most degraded, (the <i>Hetarae</i>) and seems to
have borrowed from Egypt many lowering qualities,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>
including dancing girls and ribald songs.</p>
<p>Anacreon of Teos, introduced into Greece the
light, airy songs, in praise of woman, wine, etc.,
&ldquo;It is no great stretch of fancy,&rdquo; says a thoughtful
writer,<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> &ldquo;to imagine his songs as expressing
our modern <i>Allegretto Grazioso</i>, <i>Andante Scherzoso</i>,
etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From precisely this point however (the lack of
signs of expression in all Greek music) another
writer<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> deduces the opinion that Greek music
must always have been in a crude state, and by
no means of the beauty which some enthusiasts
ascribe to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />THE PHILOSOPHERS, AND GREEK SOCIAL MUSIC.</h2>
<p>From the sixth century <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, music may date its
entrance into the positive sciences, for Pythagoras,
born about 570 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, first began to analyze
music from a scientific point of view, and to
ascertain how far it rested upon natural laws.
Pythagoras is said to have been the son of a
wealthy merchant. He was as before mentioned,
one of the earliest Greeks in Egypt, and after
having been instructed for some time by the priests,
had at last the honor of being admitted into the
Egyptian college of priesthood.</p>
<p>After remaining in Egypt twenty-two years, he
spent some time among the Chaldeans, and at last
returned, full of wisdom, to his native Samos.
But here the sensuality of the court of Polycrates
was so little to his taste, that he departed to the
city of Croton in southern Italy, where he founded
the order of Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>With the order itself, we have little to do, but
when we consider that its founder was the pioneer
of scientific musical research, its proceedings
become in some degree interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is number and harmony&rdquo; was the fundamental
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
maxim of this philosopher,<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> and he sought
for the laws in music, therefore, in nature. This
led to some mistakes of course, for the laws of
nature had not been made clear enough for
thorough guidance, in that era. It is said that
Pythagoras one day, passing by a blacksmith&rsquo;s
shop heard the blows of different hammers sound
the fundamental, fourth, fifth, and octave, and
entering, he weighed the different hammers,
thereby obtaining the proportion of these intervals
to each other.</p>
<p>This story has been proved to be a silly myth,
for the proportions given are wrong. He should
have weighed the anvils not the hammers, and
anvils of such difference in size as would be
requisite to produce these intervals would not be
seen in blacksmiths&rsquo; shops.</p>
<p>Pythagoras taught that not the ear, but
mathematics, should be the guide in music. He held
that the universe was constructed on a musical
plan, and was probably the first to introduce
among the Greeks the theory of the music of the
spheres. The fact that man could not hear this
music,<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> was explained by the statement that the
sounds were either too deep or too high for our
ears. The reasoning was plausible enough, and
has been confirmed by science, for sounds
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
of less than sixteen vibrations in a second are inaudible
on account of their depth, and those
exceeding 38,100 vibrations in a second are too
high for the human ear to perceive.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> Starting
from this premise Pythagoras formed a scale
founded on the seven planets, as known to the
astronomers of that time. This was its form:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="cs">Moon. </td><td class="cs">Mercury. </td><td class="cs">Venus. </td><td class="cs">Sun. </td><td class="cs">Mars. </td><td class="cs">Jupiter. </td><td class="cs">Saturn.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c">E </td><td class="c">F </td><td class="c">G </td><td class="c">A </td><td class="c">B </td><td class="c">C </td><td class="c">D</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The sun was Mese, the controlling middle note,
around which all the others circled.</p>
<p>The order of Pythagoreans were held together by
the firmest ties, and Pythagoras has been, not
inaptly, compared in this capacity with Ignatius
Loyola. His adherents, who numbered about
three hundred were, in most cases, wealthy and
noble, and the power of the society was always
upon the side of aristocracy.</p>
<p>Pythagoras was very select in the admission of
members, exercising great vigilance lest improper
or undesirable persons should be allowed to enter;
in this he was guided not a little by his skill in
Physiognomy. The initiates had, it is said, to
pass through a most rigorous and lengthy period
of probation, they were obliged to maintain silence
for five years,<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> and in other ways had their powers
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
of endurance, severely tested. After entering
the brotherhood,<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> the mode of life was entirely
dictated by Pythagoras. The members were
clothed in pure white. They were forbidden all
animal food, and beans. They had different
grades of advancement among themselves, the
highest being undoubtedly instructed in a purer
religion than that which obtained around them,
though outwardly they conformed with the religion
of the populace. Mathematics, music, and
astronomy were studied, and gymnastics regularly
practised.</p>
<p>Playing upon the lyre was obligatory, and none
of the order went to sleep at night, without having
previously purified his soul, and set it in harmony
through music; and at rising in the morning, the
strength for the day&rsquo;s labors and duties, was sought
for in the same manner. Pythagoras wrote many
songs as correctives to undue excitement and
passion; he is said once to have brought to reason
a young man beside himself with jealousy and
wine, by the power of a song.</p>
<p>Clinias, a Pythagorean, took up his harp and
played whenever any passion arose in his breast;
to a person who asked him the reason of the
action, he replied, &ldquo;I play to compose myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the music of Terpander, Olympus, etc.,
was intended for high state and religious purposes,
that of Pythagoras was intended to bring
the art into domestic and inner life. Choruses
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
were, however, also chanted by his followers, and
were adapted to various occasions, as for example,
at the opening of Spring, the scholars would
gather in a circle around the harper, who played
the accompaniment, and sing p&aelig;ans of welcome
to the opening season. Other philosophers also
allowed music to enter into their teachings, though
not to so great a degree, but almost all of them
understood enough of music to form an opinion.</p>
<p>Plato seemed decidedly to object to instrumental
music, for he says &ldquo;the using of instruments without
the voice is barbarism and charlatanry.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></p>
<p>Aristotle was disposed to allow more freedom,
for he spoke of music as a delicious pleasure,
either alone (instrumental) or accompanied with
voice; but in instrumental solos he admitted the
lyre and kithara only, and rejected the flute, which
he thought not to be a moral instrument, and
only capable of inflaming the passions.</p>
<p>The philosophers as a class were really not very
advantageous to musical progress, for they fought
tooth and nail for the old school of music.</p>
<p>They sought only moral effects by the means of
great simplicity, and any intricate innovations
displeased them; but in spite of their resistance
the art began to improve.</p>
<p>The Skolion, or banquet song had a great
influence on the music of Athens. At the banquet,
or symposium, the harp was passed from
hand to hand, and each person who made any
pretence to education or good breeding was
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
expected to be able to improvise or at least to sing
a good <i>skolion</i>.</p>
<p>There was certainly in the time of Pericles,
music enough to choose from, for there is much
evidence that the Athenians of that day possessed
an extensive library of music;<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> and it was
in this era, the early part of the fifth century
<span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, that the social music reached its height.</p>
<p>Themistocles once being present at a banquet
had the harp (kithara) presented to him, and was
desired to sing his <i>skolion</i>; full of confusion and
shame he was obliged to acknowledge his ignorance
of music, and we can judge of the value in which
the art was held, by the sneers and jests which
were pointed at him. At last stung to the quick
by the sharp witticisms, he retorted, &ldquo;it is true I
do not know how to play the kithara, but I know
how to raise an insignificant city to a position of
glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>skolion</i> was a really poetical and worthy
song, and must not be confounded with those
lower and vulgar songs which were sung to the
guests by hired jesters and buffoons.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>The subjects of the <i>skolion</i> were sometimes of
rather a lofty style; praise of heroes,<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> calls to the
gods, rules of life, often joyous, sometimes
sedate; but in all of them a less exact rhythm
and style were allowed than in other compositions.
A few have been preserved to our day; one
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
begins, &ldquo;my kingdom is my spear and sword,&rdquo;
another composed by Chilon contains the following
beautiful thought; &ldquo;Gold is rubbed upon the
touchstone, and thus is tested, but the soul of man
is tested by the gold, if it be good or evil.&rdquo; But
the kithara, although used in the <i>skolion</i>, was not
the only instrument of the fashionable young
men of ancient Athens, for the flute found great
favor among them; in fact flute playing grew to
be quite a mania for a time. It was part of the
musical education of youth. Most of the teachers
of the instrument came from B&oelig;otia.</p>
<p>Flute players of ability were held in high honor;
the art of flute playing received such an impetus
that different flute schools were established in
Athens; even rival methods of playing and teaching
existed.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Flutes were played in almost every place where
music was required, to accompany hymns, at worship,
and even sometimes the Greeks represented
the combat of Apollo and the Python on this
instrument, with kithara accompaniment; this
may be considered as the earliest &ldquo;song without
words&rdquo; in existence.</p>
<p>The ancients had some other attempts at tone
pictures. Once an Athenian kitharist played to
Dorian, a representation of a storm at sea; on
being asked how he liked it, that ancient wit
answered, &ldquo;I have seen a better storm in a pot of
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
boiling water.&rdquo; This would make the origin of
the phrase &ldquo;a tempest in a teapot,&rdquo; over two-thousand
years old.</p>
<p>Sometimes all Athens was divided into cliques
for this or that flute player; and the price paid for
flutes were appalling, some being sold as high as
three thousand dollars, many flute-makers becoming
immensely wealthy.</p>
<p>It received a slight check however, when Alcibiades,
about 409 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, declined to play it, alleging
as a reason, that it spoilt the shape of the mouth.
Alcibiades stood at the head of the fashion as well
as of the state, and after such a <i>dictum</i> the <i>beau
monde</i> of Athens laid aside the flute; but some
ingenious flute maker took alarm, and invented a
mouth-piece which obviated the difficulty, and
which Alcibiades found more to his taste, on which
it resumed its place in popular favor.</p>
<p>In Sparta it led the chorus, and was the military
instrument, but the Spartans disdained to make it
a study, and only felt bound, at this era, to discriminate
between good and bad music.</p>
<p>In some Ionian cities, the human victims were
led to the sacrifice, or to their execution to the
sound of flutes; and this dead march (called the
Nome of Kradias) was said to be peculiarly
depressing.</p>
<p>Plutarch makes a warm defence of the flute,
against the criticisms of Plato and Aristotle.
&ldquo;The flute&rdquo; he says &ldquo;cannot be spared from the
banquet, leads the hymns to the gods, and with its
rich and full tones spreads peace and tranquillity
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
throughout the soul;&rdquo; but we must remember that
this was written at a much later epoch, when flute
playing became more universal than in the days of
Pericles, and when the instrument had probably
been altered and improved.</p>
<p>Flute players sometimes made large fortunes.
Nicomachus was known for his wealth in jewels
acquired by his skill on the instrument.</p>
<p>Lamia was one of the most famous of Athenian
flutists. This female was celebrated through
Greece and Egypt for her skill, as well as for her
wit and beauty. The latter was not overrated,
for a portrait of her has been discovered in a signet,
which amply confirms the accounts of her
charms. Although born in Athens, she went early
to Alexandria, in Egypt, to study her art; somewhat
as our modern musicians go to Italy or
Germany. She was received with open arms at
the Egyptian court, and was detained for a long
time. Captured by Demetrius Polyorcetes, she
soon succeeded in conquering her conqueror, and
on her return to Athens, a temple was built to her,
and she was worshipped under the name of <i>Venus
Lamia</i>. Her powerful &ldquo;friend&rdquo; Demetrius, may
have had something to do with this deification,
but at all events, there were still left some Greeks
(Lysimachus for example) who had the manliness
to protest against the desecration, for the character
of Lamia was far different from that of Sappho.</p>
<p>It was not flute players only who earned
immense salaries, for we learn that Amab&oelig;us the
kitharist, received nearly one thousand dollars for
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
each performance, and all flute-players, and kitharists,
were welcomed and honored at the courts of
Greece, Egypt and Asia.</p>
<p>Ptolemy Philadelphus gave a large musical
festival in Alexandria, Egypt, about 280 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, at
which six hundred skilled singers, kitharists and
flutists assisted; there have been larger festivals
in point of numbers in ancient times, but few,
where so much educated talent assisted. Ptolemy
Physcon<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a>, an amiable Egyptian ruler, 146 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>,
who married his brother&rsquo;s wife, killed his baby
nephew, or step-son on the wedding day and afterwards
married his niece, or step-daughter (for he
made the relationship very mixed) winding up by
killing all the progeny as <i>finale</i>, seems to have
patronized and enjoyed music, in spite of his
family troubles.</p>
<p>Ptolemy Auletes, 80 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, was known as the
&ldquo;flute lover,&rdquo; and though king of Egypt was yet
a very skilful virtuoso on this instrument.</p>
<p>We must not omit here to mention a species of
Greek music which was an outgrowth of the
sacred games.</p>
<p>We have already stated how great the honor of
achieving a victory at these games was considered;
and it was very natural that when a whole city
celebrated with joy the triumph of one of its sons,
the poets would also sing in high strains, the
praises of the successful hero. These poems
soon became a necessary adjunct to the festivities,
and may be said to form a school of their own.
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
They were chanted by a chorus under the direction
of the composer; and although at first they may
have been spontaneous, yet afterwards they
became entirely a matter of purchase.</p>
<p>When a young man had carried off the victor&rsquo;s
wreath, he would frequently send word at once to
some famous poet-musician, to write a chorus in
his honor. Sometimes the city itself would order
the poem, and in Athens about 540 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, statues
began to be erected to the victors who were natives
of that city.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> Simonides, born about 556 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, may
be regarded as the founder of this style of composition,
and he certainly was the founder of the
custom of receiving pay for laudatory verses.</p>
<p>His contemporaries sneered greatly at him for
this, and Pindar proves him to have been very
avaricious, but it really seems to have been no
more than just that the poet should have been
compensated for his exertions, as he not only had
to write the poetry and music for the occasion, but
also to drill the chorus and lead the singing.</p>
<p>The ceremony of praise to the victor was either
celebrated at the conclusion of the games, upon
the spot, or upon his return home; sometimes
also in after years, to keep alive the remembrance
of past triumphs.</p>
<p>The festivities were both religious and social.
They began with a procession to the temple, after
which sacrifices were offered, either in the temple,
or in the victor&rsquo;s house; this was followed by a
banquet, to which came the poet with his chorus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
and intoned the triumphal ode, the latter being
considered the greatest event of the occasion.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></p>
<p>Simonides seems to have been in the market
for all kinds of Epinikia, or triumphal odes.
Leophron of Rhegion, having won a race with
mules at one of these games, ordered a chorus on
the subject from the poet; Simonides felt a little
indignant at the proposal and replied, curtly &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t sing about mules,&rdquo; but Leophron being
very anxious in the matter, offered a large price,
upon which Simonides reconsidered his determination,
and wrote the ode. It began by saluting the
mules in an ingenious manner, only noticing one
side of their ancestry,&mdash;&ldquo;Hail! oh ye daughters
of the stormy footed horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simonides was not wholly, however, in this
lower line of poetry; he often competed in public
musical, or poetical contests, and won fifty-six
oxen and tripods by such means. Even at eighty
years of age he added another to his lengthy list
of victories. He was also considered as very
learned, and was sometimes reckoned among the
philosophers.</p>
<p>One of his chief competitors at Athens, was
Lasus of Hermione, who was a practical and
theoretical musician of some eminence.</p>
<p>Among the works of Lasus, there are some
which are curiously constructed. In his hymn to
Diana, and in the Centaurs, the letter S (sigma)
is entirely avoided. The flute-players who
accompanied the choruses greatly disliked the
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
hissing sound of S. as it did not blend easily with
their playing, and it was this fact which probably
led Lasus to so curious a style of poetry.</p>
<p>Among the scholars of Lasus was Pindar, (born
in the spring of 522 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>,) who came from a noble
Theban family. Pindar&rsquo;s parents were musical,
and there were several flute-players in his family,
but he soon became far more than a mere flute-player.
He came to Athens, to study music, at a
very early age, for after his return to Thebes he
began a further course of studies under Corinna
and Myrtis, two famous poetesses, then in B&oelig;otia,
all of which was done before his twentieth year.</p>
<p>He strove in public contests with the two latter,
but always unsuccessfully; Corinna defeated him
five times, which result, Pausanius thinks, may
have been partly due to her personal charms.</p>
<p>Corinna once offered to beautify Pindar&rsquo;s early
efforts with mythological allusions, but on his
bringing her a poem, the first six verses of which
touched on every part of Theban Mythology, she
smiled and said: &ldquo;One must sow seed by handsfull,
not by bagsfull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pindar&rsquo;s poetic career began very early, for at
twenty years old he wrote his first Epinikion
(triumphal ode), in honor of a youth of the tribe
of Aleuads.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> His services were soon sought for
throughout all Hellas; for although he imitated
Simonides in writing for hire, yet his muse was
unquestionably a nobler one, and his <i>Epinikia</i>
bear an air of heartiness which seems to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
unfeigned. His songs were bolder and truer, and
not altogether composed of flattery, and he seems
to have been an eye-witness of many of the
triumphs which he describes.</p>
<p>He also was engaged as poet to Hiero, of Syracuse,
Alexander, (son of Amyntas of Macedonia,)
Theron of Agrigentum, Arcesilaus, King of
Cyrene, and for several free states; with the two
former he was an especial favorite, and yet his position
never seemed that of a parasite, or a courtier,
for he told them the truth bluntly when occasion
demanded. His life was chiefly spent in the
courts of his various royal friends. He once
resided at the court of Hiero, at Syracuse, for the
space of four years.</p>
<p>He died at the advanced age of eighty years.</p>
<p>The names of Simonides and Pindar may be
considered as the greatest in this branch of Greek
music and poetry; and although the subjects were
of local interest only, yet Pindar has invested
them with such beautiful imagery that he has
shown us (to alter the phrase of an ancient,) that
it is better to be a great man in a small art, than a
small man in a great one.</p>

<br />GREEK THEATRE AND CHORUS.</h2>
<p>Among the many institutions which contributed
to that polished civilization which was the glory of
ancient Greece, none were higher in aspirations,
or more prolific in results, than the Tragedies and
Comedies which were at certain intervals presented
in the Theatre at Athens. The Athenians were
by this agency, brought to a cultivated discrimination
in music and poetry, and as we shall see later,
the choruses being chosen from the body of the
people, and demanding an amount of musical
ability in the members, caused the study of music
to become almost a necessity to all.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
<p>In its early days the Drama, (if it be worthy of
the name,) must have been a mere masquerading
on any raised platform. It had its origin in the
festivities of Dionysius (Bacchus), for at the
earliest Dionysian festivals, the populace smeared
their faces in wine lees, and thus disguised, sang
choruses in honor of this god of mirth.</p>
<p>In later times, linen masks were substituted,
but only in the days of Thespis, did the art
assume some regular shape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Comedy may be said to have arisen about 562
<span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, when Susarion and Dolon travelled around,
caricaturing the vices and follies of their time,
from a rude scaffold.</p>
<p>The first Tragedy was acted in Athens, by
Thespis, from a wagon, in the year 535 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> In
the same year Thespis received a goat as reward
for playing &ldquo;Alcestis&rdquo; at Athens. Goats were
frequently given as rewards for this kind of
composition, and the word Tragedy is derived by
some, from the words Tragos, a goat, Od&eacute;, a song,
literally a &ldquo;goat-song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earliest attempt at dramatic action, with a
plot, or incident to give it connection, was the
representation of the gift of the grape to mankind,
by Dionysius; this required three <i>dramatis
personae</i>, therefore Thespis changed his linen
mask three times.</p>
<p>Solon was not well pleased with the new art;
striking his stick upon the ground he said: &ldquo;If this
sort of thing were allowed and praised, it would
soon be found in the market-place;&rdquo; and to Thespis
who was singing a recitation in the character
which he was acting, he said: &ldquo;Are you not
ashamed to lie so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solon had probably forgotten that when he
aroused the Athenians to the reconquest of Salamis,
he had assumed the character of a herald from the
island. Solon had predicted right however, the
drama became the most cherished institution of
Greece; even in its earliest stages, the state
fostered it, and it always attracted the peons for
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
it was both a religious, and popular enjoyment.</p>
<p>The sons of Pisistratus did much in these days
to encourage and stimulate it. They arranged
contests, rewards, etc., with profusion.</p>
<p>The tragedies of Thespis which he both wrote
and acted himself, had but one performer, who,
rapidly changing his mask, assumed various
different characters in the play. The monotony
was soon felt, and in order that dialogues might
be used, a chorus was introduced, and then much
of the action consisted of duets between the
solitary performer, or <i>protagonist</i>, and the chorus.</p>
<p>Phrynicus, a few years later, allowed this
single actor to take both male and female characters;
but the first thorough representation of
tragedy, with its properties carefully attended to,
is due to the great tragic poet &AElig;schylus, who
instructed the actor and the chorus carefully, and
gave attention to thoroughness in its every
department so far as then known.</p>
<p>The platform and auditorium were still uncouth
wooden structures, until a poetical contest took
place between Phrynicus and others, when the
benches were so crowded that the whole structure
gave way and many were injured; after this the
theatres were built of stone.</p>
<p>The performances were still regarded as belonging
to religious rites; the seats were at first built
in a semi-circle around the altar of Dionysius, and
the theatre never became, as with us, an every-day
matter, but was only used at certain Dionysian
festivals, which occurred about three times each
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
year. &AElig;schylus aimed very much at the terrible
in his tragedies, and the poets of this era never
sought to &ldquo;hold the mirror up to nature,&rdquo; but
rather to represent something awe-inspiring and
supernatural; therefore the actors had to prepare
themselves in many peculiar ways for the stage.</p>
<p>The characters of tragedy were represented as
much larger than human beings; to effect this the
tragedian wore a kind of stilt-shoes with very high
heels, called <i>cothurne</i>, padded out his body in
proportion to his height, lengthened his arms by
adding an artificial hand, and wore a mask of
large size, over his face. The stage upon which
he appeared, was also elevated above that on
which the chorus stood, and the latter not being
artificially enlarged, must have appeared as
pigmies, beside these gigantic heroes.</p>
<p>The voice was pitched in a style corresponding
to the magnitude of the body; it has been suggested<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a>
that the large tragic mask may have
concealed some contrivance for strengthening the
voice; however this may be, it is certain that the
voice of the tragedian needed to be metallic,
solemn and majestic, and that this, though partly
a natural gift, had to be strengthened by long and
severe practice, and a vast amount of physical
strength was also required to move about naturally
when so extremely bundled up.</p>
<p>Lucian in his &ldquo;<i>De saltatione</i>,&rdquo; ridicules the
tragic actor&rsquo;s equipment. He says: &ldquo;What a
ridiculous thing it is, to see a fellow stalking
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
around upon a pair of high heeled boots, with a
terrible mask on, and a wide gaping mouth, as if
he intended to swallow the audience,<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> not to
mention the unseemly thickness of breast and
body, all of which is done to hide the disproportion
between his extravagant height, and his
meagre body. Bawling aloud, and writhing his
body in a thousand odd gestures;&rdquo; and then he
alludes to the better singing and acting of previous
time, &ldquo;but all sense of fitness is lost,&rdquo; he concludes,
&ldquo;when Hercules enters singing a mournful
ditty, without either lion&rsquo;s skin or club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the immovable mask, Ottfried
M&uuml;ller supposes that the picture is overdrawn, for
facial expression had far less to do with the action
of the drama of that day than we imagine; the
character had not so many changing emotions to
depict, as in modern plays; he says<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> &ldquo;we can
imagine an Orestes, or a Medea, with a set
countenance, but never a Hamlet or Tasso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must also remember that the vast extent of
the Athenian Theatre, made it next to impossible
to distinguish much play of feature, and that the
same masks were not worn throughout the play, but
changed at any great change of emotion. Oedipus
in the tragedy by Sophocles, after misfortunes
came upon him, wore a different mask from the
one worn in his days of prosperity.</p>
<p>The first plays represented were relative to the
history of the gods, and demi-gods, but Phrynicus
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
made a bold innovation by representing contemporaneous
events upon the stage. He once ventured
to represent the conquest of Miletus, from the
Athenians; the effect, according to Herodotus, was
startling, the whole audience burst into tears, and
the Athenian government forbade any further
plays on that subject, prohibited the piece from
ever being represented again, and fined the poet
heavily.</p>
<p>The contests between rival writers, by simultaneous
production of their pieces was a fruitful
source of jealousy. &AElig;chylus upon being
vanquished in one of these by Sophocles, took his
defeat so much to heart, that he left Athens for
some years, and took up his residence in Sicily.</p>
<p>In the plays of Thespis and Phrynicus, one actor
only was employed; &AElig;chylus enriched his works
by adding a second performer, called the <i>Deuteragonist</i>.
Sophocles went beyond by adding the
third, or <i>Tritagonist</i>, and desired even more, for
in his Oedipus in Colonus, he found that four
players were a necessity, and wrote the tragedy
for that number, but dared not publicly make the
innovation, and therefore this great work remained
unperformed until after his death.</p>
<p>The above mentioned three performers, had
their distinct lines of duty, as we to-day have
upon the stage, actors for each kind of character,
but the distinction was carried to great height on
the ancient stage, for the first actor always came
on the stage from the right entrance, the second
from the left, and the third from the centre.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The stage of the Athenian theatre was very
wide but not deep, and the scenery was very simple;
sometimes the house of the chief character
was represented, sometimes the tent of a hero,
but oftenest the entrance of a palace, before which
the entire action of some dramas could take place.
They were always exterior views, and no scenes
of the interior parts of a dwelling were ever used.
The whole active life of the Greek was passed in
the open air, so that it seemed more natural to him
to represent his characters as living similarly.
The female characters were often personated by
boys.</p>
<p>There were many expedients to make the
following of the action of the play easier to the
spectators, in such a vast space; programmes they
had not, opera glasses did not exist, so certain
formulae took the place of both; when standing
on the stage of the Athenian theatre, and facing
the audience, the harbor and city of Athens were
on the left hand, and Attica on the right; a person
entering from the right hand, was therefore presumed
to be a stranger who had come over land;
and from the left as coming from the city.</p>
<p>The stage also possessed some mechanical
effects, such as chariots descending from the skies,
birds or even immense beetles soaring aloft
carrying persons with them, forms arising from the
deep, thunder, lightning, etc. The chorus was an
immense help to the audience in following the
events of the piece, and we must now describe
this characteristic part of Greek tragedy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The dramatic chorus probably appeared first as
Satyrs, the natural attendants of the jolly god
Dionysius, in the plays of Thespis, and were then
numerous and ill disciplined.</p>
<p>&AElig;chylus lessened the part of the chorus in
his tragedies, and they no longer sang an unceasing
duet with the Protagonist, for the addition of
a second actor, made dialogues possible without
their assistance.</p>
<p>The number of <i>Choryeutes</i> (chorus players) in
&AElig;chylus&rsquo;s tragedies was twelve; Sophocles, and
Euripides had usually fifteen.</p>
<p>In the tragedy of the &ldquo;Eumenides&rdquo; there was
a special chorus of fifty members; these were
apparelled as the hideous furies of that name, all
in black, with angry countenances, snakes twining
in their hair, and blood dripping from their eyes;
and suddenly these frightful apparitions appeared
on the stage: the effect was terrible, women
shrieked, and fell in convulsions, and several
children died of fright. This event proves that
the stage effects were rather realistic in those
days.</p>
<p>The chorus was felt as an inconvenience by
Euripides, who yet could not break the shackles
of custom sufficiently to do away with it.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the chorus was changed
when it was transplanted from lyric to dramatic
use. The dithyrambic chorus stood around an
altar singing hymns, and was wholly occupied
with its music: the dramatic chorus stood in the
shape of a square, the director taking good care
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
to place the best dressed and handsomest choryeutes
in front.</p>
<p>The songs were accompanied with well regulated
movements, usually of a stately and dignified
character, such as befitted the characters which
they were representing, the parts which they
performed usually being those of Matrons or
Patriarchs, who were best suited to give counsel,
comfort, or admonition to the acting characters of
the drama.</p>
<p>The formation of choruses, was a matter of
legislation. The archon of the city, gave the
task of forming the choruses, to some of the
wealthy citizens, who had the title of <i>Choregus</i>.
This person was not the chorus leader, but the
founder of it. He had authority from the archon
to receive and select able singers; when he had
the organization formed, he engaged a <i>choryphaeus</i>
or director, to instruct the members in singing
and dancing; he engaged flute-players<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> to accompany
them, and paid a regular salary to them all,
that of the flute-players being higher than that of
the singers. He had to board and lodge them; to
supply them with good beverages during rehearsals;
to see that they received nutritious food, and
such as was good for their voices; to supply them
with masks, and costumes for their parts, and
other duties all tending to the well being of the
chorus. The choregus received no pay for this,
but if in a dramatic contest his chorus was
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
adjudged to be the best, he received a wreath as
a reward.</p>
<p>Expensive as this honor was, yet it was sought
after by all the richer class of Athens, as it was
an ostentatious manner of showing their munificence,
for the tragic choruses vied with each other
in the splendor of their attire, their costumes being
superb mantles of gold, and purple. So costly
was it that the saying became a well known
jest, that the way to ruin a man, was to get him
appointed choregus.</p>
<p>The costume of the actors was also rich, without
much reference to the part they were playing.
Hercules came on the stage in purple and gold
instead of with a lion&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>The poet who had just completed a tragedy, and
succeeded in obtaining a hearing for it, applied to
the Archon for a chorus; that functionary, if he
had confidence in the applicant, would assign him
one of the choruses which had already been formed
and on receiving the permission from the <i>choregus</i>,
the composer would set to work, drilling them in
their various songs, attitudes, and movements.
The director did not use a stick for this purpose,
as in modern days, but beat the time with a heavy
pair of iron shoes which he put on for the purpose.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a>
The chorus of comedy was a less expensive
and smaller affair. The music which it sang was
also less difficult and grand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The comedy chorus consisted of twenty-four
members, who came on the stage in detachments
of six each.</p>
<p>The comedy costumes of both actors and chorus
were something like what we are accustomed to
see in farce or pantomime; there was something
comical and exaggerated about them, which
occasioned mirth of itself. The masks were
decidedly comic, and usually caricatured the countenance
of some public person well known to the
audience. The comedy, especially in the older
days that of Aristophanes sought to teach the
people by holding up to ridicule, all such persons
or measures as seemed to the poet worthy of censure;
therefore it dealt almost exclusively with
the events of the day, and such characters as
Alcibiades, Socrates, Cleon, etc., are constantly
appearing, and in the most mirth-provoking
manner.</p>
<p>It is a matter of regret, however, that Aristophanes
wielded so much influence, for he
brought it to bear against Socrates, whom he was
narrow-minded enough to take as the representative
of Sophistry, and raised a popular feeling
against him by his comedy of &ldquo;The Clouds,&rdquo; in
which he attributed the most interested motives to
that grand philosopher.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate for Cleon that the caricature
of Aristophanes was accepted as a portrait, and
he has come down to us only as the noisy impudent
demagogue, as portrayed in &ldquo;The Knights;&rdquo;
yet Cleon must have been a rough and sturdy
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
leader of the populace, to have attained so much
power.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
<p>Aristophanes was aristocratic in his tendencies,
and could not forgive the tanner, for having risen
from his humble sphere.</p>
<p>It required much courage however to attack
the leader of the democracy, with such boldness.
Even the mask makers refused to make the comic
mask of Cleon; and when the mask was obtained
no actor dared to play the character, so that
Aristophanes was obliged to act it himself. Cleon
embroiled Aristophanes in three lawsuits in consequence
of his audacity.</p>
<p>The choruses of these comedies had sometimes
to assume very odd parts, as in the two comedies
of the &ldquo;Birds,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Wasps,&rdquo; where they
represented those creatures. The masks were
made to correspond to the character assumed, and
in &ldquo;The Wasps&rdquo; each man had a short spear or
sting, which they sometimes thrust out, or drew in,
and the whole chorus would sometimes move about
quickly with a buzzing noise. The wasps were a
satire upon the swarm of Athenian magistrates.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
<p>One is forcibly reminded in these plays of the
recent inventions of the French <i>Opera Bouffe</i>.</p>
<p>In the later comedies, private intrigues began to
form the plot, and there was no great difference
between these and the plays of modern times.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />THE DANCES OF ANCIENT GREECE.</h2>
<p>The dances of Greece were of considerable
variety, and seem to have been both refined and
coarse in their character. The earliest were probable
merely military man&oelig;uvres, which were
performed to songs, or to accompaniment of flute
or kithara: or festival dances at the Bacchanalian
or Dionysian revels. The chief dances may be
classed as the Pyrrhic, the Cordax, and the
Emmeleia.</p>
<p>The chorus itself, in very early times, was, in
some parts of Greece only used to heighten the
effect of a solo song, by its pantomimic dancing.</p>
<p>In Crete, youths and maidens joined hands and
danced in a circle; in the centre of such a circle
sat the musician, who sang to the accompaniment
of a kithara, while the chorus expressed
by their actions, <i>not by singing</i>, the various
emotions which he chanted.</p>
<p>The Pyrrhic, or war dance, was the pride of all
Greece, and all young men studied it.</p>
<p>In Sparta there was a law that all parents should
send their sons, above the age of five years, to the
public place, to have them instructed in the armed
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
dance; on these occasions they were led by the
teachers who made them sing hymns, etc., as they
danced. The Pyrrhic was in fact, a mock battle,
in four parts, representing the pursuit, overtaking,
combat, and capture of the enemy, and was used
as drill, to make young men proficient in the use
of their weapons; it was accompanied by flute,
which instrument was the one which the Greeks
thought aroused the energies most.</p>
<p>The origin of the Pyrrhic is given as follows,&mdash;When
Zeus, (Jupiter) was born, his father
Kronos, (Saturn) knowing that he should be
dethroned by him sought his life; he was hidden
by the Corybantes, who on Kronos&rsquo; coming near,
fearing that the child would be discovered by its
crying, began to dance about, and clashed their
swords and shields, thus drowning its voice and
saving its life.</p>
<p>Dancing was equal, and often combined, with
singing, and was held in the highest estimation by
the upper classes, and even the philosophers of
ancient Greece; though of course only in its higher
branches, the lower being usually abandoned to
paid performers, as we to-day draw a wide distinction
between a fashionable ball-room dance, and a
ballet, though both are called dancing.</p>
<p>Skill in dancing, was a most envied accomplishment,
for it meant both grace, and the talent of
expressing all emotions without words.</p>
<p>Lucian<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a> says the real art of the dance is to
express an action, and gives a long list of mythological
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
and historical deeds which were suited
to representation. &ldquo;The dancer&rdquo; he says &ldquo;must
understand history, mythology, rhetoric,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>One person performed the whole dance, no
matter how many characters were included in the
action, and therefore he had to change his dress
sometimes with much rapidity. The Proteus of
the fables, is imagined to have been only a dancer
skilled in sudden changes.</p>
<p>The philosophers not only praised, but practised
the art. Plato led a chorus of dancing boys; and
considered those to be rough, uncouth churls who
disliked so pleasant a gift of the gods.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>Alcibiades danced in public, arrayed in great
splendor. Sophocles was a celebrated dancer, and
leader of dancing; while yet a boy, after the Greek
victory at Salamis, he is said to have danced
(according to some, naked) before the trophies.</p>
<p>Socrates often entertained his guests with
dancing, and studied it himself at an advanced
age.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>Exact information respecting the dance is lacking,
some commentators deeming it to have been
very like our modern ballet, others maintaining
that there was a vast difference; Czerwinski and
Wieland hold the former opinion, and to all
appearance justly. Some erudite writers have
endeavored to give the most circumstantial
accounts of the ancient manner of dancing.</p>
<p>Meibomius, one of the earliest writers on this
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
subject, endeavored to dance an ancient Greek
dance to an ancient Greek tune, before the court
of Sweden, and Scaliger in the sixteenth century
danced the Pyrrhic dance fully armed, before the
Emperor Maximilian;<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> both assumed far too much
knowledge in the matter.</p>
<p>There were undoubtedly numerous dancing
schools, and possibly also some set figures prescribed
in certain dances, but these figures had no
names attached to them, and cannot be determined
with certainty. The time was marked as in
chorus, by a leader, tapping on the floor with
heavy iron shoes. There are indications that a
dance similar to the Virginia reel, and other
contra dances were known to them; also a dance
which resembled the game of &ldquo;follow-my-leader,&rdquo;
where all imitated the postures and gestures of a
leader.</p>
<p>Many variations were allowed; Cleisthenes
having promised the hand of his daughter to the
most successful dancer among her lovers, Hippoclides,
of Athens, tried an innovation on the usual
style; having danced the Emmeleia, or tragic dance
successfully, he ordered the attendants to bring him
a table, upon which he sprang, and standing
on his head gesticulated with <i>his legs</i>. Cleisthenes
indignant at this new departure, exclaimed &ldquo;Oh
son of Tisander you have undanced your marriage;&rdquo;
Cleisthenes caring more for his skill
than for his marriage, replied &ldquo;that is perfectly
immaterial to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The Emmeleia, was the stately dance belonging
to tragedy, and was the one most practised by the
poets of that time, as they were often obliged
to teach it to the chorus, thus adding the business
of dancing master, to their already numerous
duties.</p>
<p>The Sicinis was a dance of demi-gods, and was
suited to the immense figure of the heroes of
tragedy, already described. There was also a
dance representing Theseus wandering about
in the labyrinth, the figures of which must have
been very twisted and irregular.</p>
<p>There was a species of dancing at banquets
and revels, by paid female performers, at which
the shape and form of the dancer were as lavishly
displayed as in the modern ballet.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a></p>
<p>The Cordax, or comic dance was throughout
vulgar and unseemly, and no Athenian could dance
it unmasked, without bringing down upon himself
the reproach of the greatest impudence and
immodesty. It was so outrageous that the comic
poets often tried to do without it. Aristophanes,
in &ldquo;The Clouds&rdquo; prides himself that he does not
use it in that comedy. The <i>cordax</i> was a dance
wherein the utmost vulgarity was not only allowed
but <i>demanded</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a></p>
<p>Lucian in his treatise &ldquo;<i>de Saltatione</i>&rdquo; intimates
the existence of various other dances which in his
day had fallen into desuetude, as the dance of the
<i>Cranes</i>; also the Phrygian dance, which was only
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
to be danced when the performers were drunk,
and jumped about, with uncouth irregular leaps
to the music of the flute.</p>
<p>Lucian also gives a specimen of the raillery of
the people, when the dancer was not suited to the
part; when a small person undertook to act Hector,
they would call out, &ldquo;we want Hector, not Astyanax.&rdquo;
To a fat dancer, on making a leap they
called &ldquo;be careful, you&rsquo;ll break the stage;&rdquo; and
to a lean, sickly looking dancer they cried &ldquo;go
home, and nurse yourself, never mind dancing.&rdquo;
Such little remarks are not unsuited to the <i>gamins</i>
of the New York or London theatres.</p>
<p>We have dwelt rather long upon Greek Music,
Theatre Chorus, and Dancing, but the subject has
more than usual interest, as in the Greek art, of
all descriptions, we find the seeds from whence
has sprung our own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />ANCIENT ROMAN MUSIC.</h2>
<p>Art-love was not a distinguishing characteristic
of the ancient Romans, and we are not astonished
therefore, to find them borrowing music from
Etruria, Greece, and Egypt; originating nothing,
and (although the study was pursued by the
Emperors) never finding anything higher in its
practice than a sensuous gratification.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of Rome, the inhabitants
were exclusively farmers, or warriors, and their
first temples were raised to Ceres, or to Mars.</p>
<p>The priests of Ceres came originally from Asia
Minor, and were called the Arval Brotherhood;
flute-playing was a prominent feature in their
rites, and they were all proficient upon that instrument.
Their number was limited to twelve.</p>
<p>The worship of Mars was conducted by the
Salian priests, whom Numa summoned to Rome,
from Etruria. These also used the flute as an
accessory to their sacrificial rites. In these primitive
days of Rome, much was borrowed from the
Etruscans, in style and instruments of music.</p>
<p>The earliest songs of Rome were in praise of
Romulus, and told the story of the twin brothers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
and the divine origin of the city. They were sung
by choruses of boys. Similar songs were sung
during meals by the elders, with an accompaniment
of flutes; these latter songs being especially
directed to the young men and inciting them to
be worthy of the deeds of their ancestors.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a></p>
<p>Under the rule of the Emperors, all these
worthy compositions went to decay, and were
replaced by a much more degrading school of
music. At no time, however, was music considered
a necessary part of the education of Roman youth.</p>
<p>There existed in the later days of ancient Rome,
some music schools, but the study was far less
universally pursued, than in Greece, at the same
epoch. The musical course, has been given by
Quintilian, as follows,&mdash;</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Theoretical</dt>

<dd class="t">Poetry</dd>
<dd>Execution</dd>
<dd class="t">Playing Instruments</dd>
<dd class="t">Singing</dd>
<dd class="t">Dramatic Action</dd></dl>
<p>Which makes a rather formidable array, even to
modern eyes.</p>
<p>Among the Roman musical instruments, the
flute was the most popular, and essentially national.
We have already stated, that it was used in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
worship of their two chief deities; it was in secular
use to a yet greater extent.</p>
<p>This flute (Tibia) was hooped with brass bands,
and had an immense resonance. It was used by
both sexes, but in public, and on most religious
occasions, was played by men.</p>
<p>The frequency with which it was used, made
the art of playing it, a most remunerative one,
and the flute-players soon formed themselves into
a guild, or protective society. This guild had
many privileges accorded to it, and existed for a
period of some centuries. The &ldquo;Guild of
Dionysian Artists&rdquo; was a society of later date,
and was a Musical Conservatory, Academy, and
Agency all in one. It flourished greatly under
the patronage of various Roman Emperors, and
for a long time supplied singers and actors to the
Roman world.</p>
<p>Valerius Maximus<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> has given an anecdote
which shows how powerful, and exacting the
Guild of flute-players could afford to be.</p>
<p>They were one day excluded from the Temple
of Jupiter, where they had been allowed, by
ancient custom, to take their meals; upon which
the entire Guild left Rome, and went to the village
of Tibur near by. This caused great embarrassment,
no religious services could be held, and
scarce any state ceremony properly conducted.
The senate thereupon sent an embassy to induce
them to return; in vain, the angry musicians were
inflexible. The wily embassadors then called the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
inhabitants of Tibur to their aid, and these pretended
to give a great feast, to welcome the flute-players.
At this feast, the musicians were all
made very drunk, and while asleep from the
effects of their liquor, they were bundled into
chariots and driven back to Rome, where all their
old privileges were restored, and newer, and
greater ones added.</p>
<p>They received the right to give public representations,
and spectacles, in Rome; but at these they
were always masked, the reason given, being their
shame at the manner of their inglorious return to
the city.</p>
<p>Flutes were used at funerals, and it appears that
at one time the luxury and pomp of Roman
obsequies grew so excessive that a law was passed
limiting the number of flute-players on such
occasions to ten.</p>
<p>Only at one time did the flute disappear from any
public worship, and that was when the worship of
Bacchus was introduced into Rome. To this rite
the kithara was used; but this worship which was
somewhat refined, though jovial, among the
Greeks, became among the Romans so debauched
and uxorious, that it was soon prohibited by law.</p>
<p>The flute was used in combination with other
instruments at times. Apuleius speaks of a concert
of flutes, kitharas and chorus, and mentioned its
deliciously sweet effect. It was also used as a
pitch pipe, to give orators a guide in modulating
their voices when addressing an assembly; thus
Caius Gracchus always on such occasions, had a
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
slave behind him, whose duty it was to aid him to
commence his orations in a proper pitch, and
when his voice sank too low, or became too shrill,
to call him to better intonation by the sounds of
the flute.</p>
<p>Although the flute was the favorite Roman
instrument, it was by no means the only one.
Trumpets were used to a great extent. A one-toned
trumpet of very loud voice, was used for
battle signals. These were of very large size,
usually of brass, and their sound is described as
&ldquo;terrible.&rdquo; There was also a smaller, shepherd&rsquo;s
trumpet of mellower tone.</p>
<p>Another much used instrument, of peculiar
character, was the <i>sumphonium</i> which did not
differ materially from the modern bag-pipe.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></p>
<p>Instruments of percussion, were few, and not
indigenous to the Romans; such as were used came
from the East, and were chiefly used in the worship
of Eastern deities, at Rome. When the
worship of Bacchus was prohibited, they passed
away, with that licentious rite. The most complicated
instrument of the ancient world, appeared
in Rome during the first century of our era. It
was an <i>Organ</i>, not as in the scriptural days a
mere syrinx, or Pans-pipes, but an undoubted
organ somewhat similar in its effect to our
modern instrument.</p>
<p>The instrument is said to have been invented by
Ctesebius of Alexandria, in Egypt, who lived
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
about 250 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> They did not appear extensively
in Rome however, until nearly 300 years later.
This organ has given rise to much fruitless discussion.
In the field of musical history especially,
&ldquo;a little knowledge&rdquo; has proved &ldquo;a dangerous
thing,&rdquo; for where slight descriptions exist of
instruments or music, latitude is left for every
writer to form his own theory, to fight for it, and
denunciate those who differ from it.</p>
<p>We have seen what a battle was fought over the
three little manuscripts of Greek music, what a
host of differing opinions were held about the
Scriptural word &ldquo;Selah,&rdquo; and now about this
hydraulic organ, each writer mounts his hobby
horse, and careers over the field of conjecture.
Vitruvius, has given a full description of the
instrument from personal inspection, but as his
technical terms have lost all significance to
modern readers, and have been translated in
various ways, and as his work contained no diagrams,
or illustrations of the various parts, it is
useless.</p>
<p>Some writers<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> imagine the organ to have had
seven or eight stops, that is, so many different
<i>kinds</i> of tones, which would place them nearly on
a par with our own. Others<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> think that they possessed
seven or eight <i>keys</i>, that is so many <i>tones</i> only.
It has been a point of dispute as to what function
the water performed in working it. Vitruvius is
rather hazy on this point, saying only that it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
&ldquo;suspended&rdquo; in the instrument. The water,
when the organ was played was in a state of agitation,
as if boiling.</p>
<p>There are medals still in existence, which were
awarded to victors in organ contests, on which this
instrument is represented, with two boys blowing
or pumping, but the representation is too small to
clear up any doubtful points.</p>
<p>So much is certain, the organs were very powerful
in tone, being therefore the instruments best
adapted to the large amphitheatres of Rome, and
were extremely popular, for it was complained
that young men forsook their other studies to learn
to play them. The only possibility yet remaining
that their construction may be known to us, is in
the chance of discovering one in Pompeii.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a></p>
<p>The functions of music in Rome were similar,
though in a less degree, to its uses in Greece. At
the sacrifice, the banquet, the contest, and the
theatre, music was always an important adjunct.
Prophets sometimes inspired themselves by it, as
in the east.</p>
<p>There were various games, public and private,
at which competition in music took place. But it
was not, as in Greece, an art of simplicity and
feeling; the love of the extraordinary, the colossal
and <i>outre</i>, the desire for the most vulgar modes
and excess of obscenity, soon degraded the art
from the rude simplicity it possessed in the days
of the republic.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>This desire for colossal effects was apparent in
the Roman games. Seneca says that in Nero&rsquo;s
time, the chorus was more numerous than formerly
the whole audience. Hosts of trumpeters, flute-players,
etc., crowded the stage. It is also well
illustrated in the splendor of the Triumph.</p>
<p>Triumphs were of two kinds, the lesser of which
was called <i>Ovatio</i>, and was decreed for unimportant
or easily-gained victories.</p>
<p>The grand Triumph (for important victories)
was the highest military honor that could be
bestowed.</p>
<p>When it had been decreed by the Senate, the
victorious General entered Rome by the triumphal
gate, where he was met by a procession of the
entire Senate; here he gave an oration in praise
of the valor of his army, and entering his triumphal
chariot, the procession began. The order was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Musicians, singing and playing. These were
chiefly trumpeters, and the singers chanted
triumphal songs.</p>
<p>The Senate and Magistrates.</p>
<p>The animals for the sacrifice, usually oxen, with
their horns gilt, and decked with garlands,
accompanied by the priests.</p>
<p>Music, flute players, to assist at the sacrificial
rites.</p>
<p>Wagons, filled with statues, plate, armor,
ensigns, etc., the spoil captured from the enemy.</p>
<p>The tribute from various countries, usually
golden crowns, or ornaments sent to grace the
occasion.</p>

<p>The captive leaders, kings, or generals, with
their wives, in chains.</p>
<p>Lictors with the fasces twined with laurel.</p>
<p>Musicians and dancers dressed as Satyrs,
crowned with gold. In the midst of these was a
mimic, dressed as a female, who by his performance
and gestures, insulted and burlesqued the
captives.</p>
<p>Persons sprinkling perfumes.</p>
<p>The victorious general, dressed in purple and
gold, crowned with laurel; he was seated in a
circular chariot, drawn by four white horses. In
his right hand he held a branch of laurel, in his
left an ivory sceptre, surmounted by an eagle.
His face was painted of a vermilion color, and a
golden <i>bulla</i> hung from his neck.</p>
<p>Sometimes the chariot was drawn by elephants.</p>
<p>The children of the victor were allowed to ride
with him, and he was attended by many relatives
and citizens dressed in white. Behind him stood
a slave carrying a richly gemmed crown, whose
duty it was to admonish him constantly during the
triumph, by whispering in his ear, &ldquo;Remember
that thou art a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Military Tribunes followed, and the procession
closed with,&mdash;</p>
<p>The whole army, horse and foot, crowned with
laurel, and carrying various ornaments which they
had won in the war.</p>
<p>They sang as they marched, the praises of their
general, and of their own bravery; but sometimes
(for it was a day of license and carnival)
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
they sang the coarsest ribaldry and jokes concerning
their leader; thus the army of Julius C&aelig;sar,
sang some very personal and vulgar verses about
him, at his triumph.</p>
<p>The procession moved from the <i>Porta Triumphalis</i>,
along the <i>Via Sacra</i> to the capitol.</p>
<p>All the shops were closed, the temples all open.
The buildings along the route were decorated.
Stands and scaffoldings were erected for the convenience
of spectators. Banquets were spread
before every house, to which all comers were
welcome. It was in short a perfect carnival, but
far exceeding in its proportions that of modern
Rome.</p>
<p>When the procession arrived at the Temple of
Jupiter at the Capitol, several of the captive
leaders were taken from the ranks, and put to
death, for ancient Rome was cruel even in her
rejoicings; the oxen were also sacrificed, and the
wreaths, with which their horns were decorated,
were thrown into the lap of Jupiter&rsquo;s statue.</p>
<p>In the evening there was a grand banquet to the
victorious General (Imperator), after which he
was escorted to his home with music and song.</p>
<p>Nothing better illustrates the cruel, coarse, and
sensual character of Roman music than that
employed at such a triumph. Loud trumpet tones,
a vile and ungenerous musical pantomime, the
sacrificial music, and rude impromptu songs of
the soldiery were the chief musical accessories of
the greatest popular festival.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />MUSIC OF THE ROMAN THEATRE.</h2>
<p>In Rome as in ancient Greece there was a
school of music, which was devoted to the stage;
but it was not held in such high esteem, nor was
it the work of the poet to supply it.</p>
<p>In the French <i>operas bouffes</i> of our day we find
the libretto and music to be the work of different
persons, and in this respect the Roman comedies
resembled them, save that while we rank the
music above the text, the Romans valued the
words far more than the music; but in other
respects there was also much resemblance between
the Roman tragedies and modern <i>Opera Seria</i>.
They divided the music into parts, such as dialogues
or duets, solos, and choruses.</p>
<p>Cicero says that a connoisseur could instantly
determine by the style of the music alone, what
tragedy was being performed; this would indicate
an amount of tone-painting, which justifies our
comparison of the Roman with the modern stage.</p>
<p>The theatres were, as usual, of immense size.
The Emperor Trajan built an Odeum, or music
hall, of which Apollodorus was the architect,
which was capable of seating twelve thousand
spectators. These structures were usually built
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
of stone, and in the most thorough manner; there
is however one notable exception to the rule. In
the reign of Tiberius an amphitheatre erected by
Atilius at Fiden&aelig;, fell in during a gladiatorial
contest, and twenty thousand persons lost their
lives.<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a></p>
<p>The music of the stage, tended rather to
virtuosity than to real beauty, the natural result
being, that while Rome possessed many skillful
performers, she had no musical composers of
eminence.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> The names of the composers of
music to the comedies of Terence and Plautus are
still extant, but they seem to have enjoyed no
special renown.</p>
<p>Quintilian speaks of the weak and womanish
music of the stage, and Martial in satirizing the
Gaditanian female singers which were so much
sought for in the later days of ancient Rome, says,
that it was the surest sign of a fashionable dandy,
to hear a young man trilling out the latest Gaditanian
ditties.</p>
<p>Many of the theatrical performers and singers
were slaves, who were bought for the purpose,
and the most stringent and cruel measures were
taken to prevent them from ruining their voices
by any kind of debauchery. Theatrical factions
also existed for this or that singer, in which at
times many lives were lost.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> Laws were afterwards
enacted, to guard against such riots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Another and less tolerable branch of Roman
public musical diversion was the dance, which
although most skillfully performed by talented
pantomimists, was so indecent in its general
character, and choice of subjects, that it received
strong condemnation from many writers of that
day.</p>
<p>Many anecdotes remain, showing how well acted
this art must have been.</p>
<p>Demetrius, the cynic (in the reign of Nero)
having reproached a dancer, that his art was but
an adjunct to music, the performer caused the
musical accompanists to cease playing, and enacted
the subject of Mars and Venus without music,
and in such a manner that Demetrius was obliged
to retract, and said, &ldquo;Even your hands seem to
speak.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a></p>
<p>The professional dancers, or musical pantomimists,
were most appreciated under the luxurious
reign of the C&aelig;sars. A prince of Pontus once
came to the court of Nero, where he was royally
entertained; as he did not understand the Latin
language, he could not appreciate theatrical
representations, but a celebrated dancer appearing,
he was able to understand his actions from beginning
to end. On his departure, when Nero had
given him presents, he said &ldquo;If instead, you
would give me this dancer, it would be the greatest
favor of all;&rdquo; on being asked the reason, he
replied that he had many barbarian neighbors,
whose language he did not understand, and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
such an unfailing interpreter would be of incalculable
value to him.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a></p>
<p>We can learn how much these performers
entered into their acting by the following
anecdote. A dancer once acting the part of Ajax,
in a double character dance, became so frenzied,
that he tore the clothes off from the time-beater,
(or conductor of music) seized the flute of the
accompanist and broke it over the head of Ulysses.
The better class of spectators condemned such a
novel exhibition, but the lower orders applauded
vociferously. The performer afterwards became
calm again, but, on being desired to repeat the
performance, he replied that it was sufficient for a
man to make a fool of himself <i>once</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a></p>
<p>The dance in Rome was esteemed only as an
amusement and sensual enjoyment, and was not
studied by the respectable classes, save sometimes
in connection with singing, in which case it was
not driven to such excess as the pantomime dance
described above; but neither song, instruments,
or dance were studied to any large extent among
the masses of the Roman people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />MUSIC OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.</h2>
<p>Under the luxurious reign of the C&aelig;sars, music
attained unusual prominence in Rome, but it was
still the music of virtuosity, rather than true art.
Skillful performers multiplied, while talented
composers did not exist. The choruses were
augmented to the utmost, their numbers exceeding
all previous extent.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> New instruments began
also to appear, the sumphonia, the hydraulic
organ, and others. The study of music began to
be fashionable (in some at least of its branches)
and the emperors themselves did not disdain to
practise the art. It is a singular fact, however,
that exactly those emperors who were the greatest
rascals, took the greatest interest in music.
Domitian founded games in honor of Jupiter, in
which he introduced Kithara playing and other
musical contests to amuse the populace. Heliogabalus
sang, danced, played the flute, organ, and
pandura, and was proficient in giving musical
recitations with flute accompaniment. Caligula
studied singing and dancing, and was so fond of
the former, that when at the theatre, he could
scarcely ever refrain from following the melodies
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
which the tragedians sang, by humming along
with them. It is related of him,<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> that during the
height of his power and tyranny, he sent, one
night, a summons to three men of consular rank,
to attend him at once at his palace; in fear and
terror, the three hastened to obey, scarcely doubting
that the night was to be their last on earth;
on arriving, they were most agreeably surprised to
hear the sound of flutes, and the emperor himself
suddenly burst out before them, arrayed in full
theatrical costume, and sang them a song, after
which he bowed and retired, upon which they
were dismissed, and returned to their anxious
families; we can imagine that, under the circumstances,
Caligula received very hearty applause
that night.</p>
<p>Vespasian established musical games, and gave
large sums to actors and singers.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a></p>
<p>Titus was a good singer and player.</p>
<p>In the later days of paganism, when the music
of the Christian church had already manifested
its power and superiority, the Emperor Julian
endeavored to bolster up the religion of the
ancestors, and fight the church with one of its
own weapons. He therefore sought to make an
extensive reform in the religious and sacrificial
music. He endeavored to form music schools at
Alexandria, in Egypt, where a new school of
singing and composition might be inculcated, and
whence Rome might draw the material for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
better religious music than had formerly
obtained. In one of his letters, he says: &ldquo;I
deem no study more worthy of attention than
good music. I desire that you select from among
the population of Alexandria certain well born
lads, who shall be supplied each with two Egyptian
artabai per month, besides rations of corn,
wine and oil, and be provided also with clothes by
the comptroller of the treasury. The boys are to
be chosen for a definite time according to their
voice. Should any give promise of further abilities
to reach a high degree in the science of music,
let them be informed that we propose to offer to
such, very substantial rewards. That the minds
of these lads will, independently of our encouragement,
be benefited by that cleansing power which
perfect music exerts, we may rest assured on the
authority of those who in past times have laid
down excellent regulations on the subject. So
much for the new choristers. As for those now
under the instruction of the music master Dioscurus,
make them act here all the more diligently
to their practice. Since we are prepared to assist
them in whatever way they may choose.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a></p>
<p>This beautiful scheme was frustrated by the
death of its great originator, about two years
afterward.</p>
<p>But among all the Roman Emperors, none was
a more passionate virtuoso, and devotee of skillful
music than that incomprehensible monster, Nero.
We shall enter into considerable detail regarding
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
this curious emperor, as he may stand as a type
(although an exaggerated one) of the soulless and
sensual musical <i>virtuosi</i> of his era. In giving his
history (so far as it relates to music) we follow
mainly the version of Suetonius.</p>
<p>He studied music in his early youth, and first
appeared publicly in the games of the Roman
youth, entitled the <i>Juvenalia</i>;<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a> here he seems to
have made no remarkable impression, either by
his voice or dramatic action. Immediately on his
accession to the throne, he sent for the famous
harper Terpnus, and took the greatest pleasure in
his performances; it was his habit to sit with him
after supper till late into the night. At last he
began to practice upon the instrument himself;
and at the same time he began to apply himself
assiduously to the cultivation of his voice, although
it is the testimony of all his historians, that his
voice was rather thin and husky.</p>
<p>The care he lavished upon the preservation of
his voice, far out-does that of any modern <i>prima
donna</i>; he would lie on his back during part of
each day, with a sheet of lead on his stomach, or
chest; he used emetics and clysters copiously when
it seemed at all out of order; his food was always
regulated with reference to its effect upon his
voice, and he forbore from eating many fruits and
pickles, because they were prejudicial to it.</p>
<p>He never delivered any addresses to his army
because he feared that he might thereby strain it;
all his speeches to the soldiers were delivered by
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
proxy, even though he were present. On all
occasions, he had his voice-master by him, to
caution him whenever he should be in danger of
over-straining, and this instructor was ordered, if
the warning should by any cause be unheeded, to
clap a napkin upon his mouth by way of enforcing
his advice. Through the whole reign of this
emperor however, there was never less misery
than while he was applying himself to his musical
education, or was upon his musical tours.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the improvement (real or
imagined) in his voice, he became desirous of
appearing upon the public stage. The unjust
valuation which he placed upon the art, being
apparent by his remark that &ldquo;music unheard, was
valueless and unregarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first public appearance took place at Naples,
<span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 63; while singing, the theatre was shaken
by an earthquake, but Nero was not to be checked,
even by the elements, and sang to the end of his
song.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> After the theatre had been vacated, it
fell in; and Nero composed lengthy hymns to the
gods for his escape.<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a></p>
<p>On his return to Rome he was desirous of
showing his skill in that metropolis; at first he
only sang to select audiences of friends at his own
palace, but infatuated with the applause of this
flattering circle, he was only too glad to follow
their suggestion that such a fine voice should not
be hidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>He instituted games in his own honor, entitled
the <i>Neronia</i>, which were celebrated in imitation
of the Greek sacred games, every fifth year;
at these games he had introduced contests of
flute and organ-players; he was too impatient
to wait until the allotted interval should have
expired, but ordered that the games should be
celebrated in advance of their accustomed time,
and placed his name on the list of musical
competitors;<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> the Senate sought to avert such a
disgrace, by offering to decree the victory to him,
without requiring him to compete, but Nero
answered, that he stood in no need of favor or
protection; that he depended entirely upon himself
and upon his own merits; that he would fairly
enter the lists, and that the decision should come
from the judges.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> When his name was called, he
came on in his regular turn, attended by a suite of
high military officials, one of whom bore his harp.
After taking his place he announced that he
would sing the story of Niobe; this he did, and
kept it up for hours, but at the conclusion he
(suddenly changing from singer to emperor)
deferred the awards of the judges for one year,
as this afforded him an opportunity to appear
again in that time.</p>
<p>The people gave on this occasion immense
applause, but whether they were most pleased by
the music, or by the novelty of the whole affair,
is doubtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>But Nero could not wait even the exceptionally
short time which he had set, and appeared at
numerous private shows, which were given from
time to time by private individuals of wealth and
station. For these performances he was glad to
be offered compensation, not from any avaricious
motive, but because it stamped him as a thorough
and professional artist; of course many courtiers
took advantage of this foible and were very glad
to pay him a princely <i>honorarium</i>. He was offered
on one occasion 1,000,000 sesterces for one appearance;
this sum being equivalent to $37,500
puts the enormous salaries of the modern prima
donna to the blush.</p>
<p>He sometimes sang for two or three days in the
same place, only pausing occasionally to take
refreshments and recuperate, and seldom was any
song of his less than a day in length.</p>
<p>This in itself might have been an easily-avoided
bore under ordinary circumstances, but he prevented
the possibility of a decreasing audience,
by posting sentinels at the doors, and forbidding
all egress. We can judge of the terrible dullness
of these occasions by the fact that some spectators,
at times, jumped from the windows, at the risk of
their limbs, while others feigned death and were
carried out for burial.<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></p>
<p>There were spies scattered through the
audience, and any inattention to the emperor&rsquo;s
singing was dangerous. The soldiers chastised
every one who did not applaud properly. If any
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
of the lower classes presumed to give adverse
criticism, they were summarily dealt with, while
those of the upper rank who showed their weariness,
were marked out for future vengeance. The
emperor had in reality the life of any subject in
his power, while seemingly only exerting legal
authority; for he had hundreds of informers,
spies and perjurers about his court who could
fasten any charge on any person however high in
station, and the awe-struck senate was always
ready to condemn. Many when charged with any
crime by the emperor&rsquo;s minions, at once committed
suicide as the shortest way out of the scrape.</p>
<p>Among those who fell under Nero&rsquo;s displeasure
for not appreciating his music, was the future
emperor Vespasian, who during one of the songs,
fell fast asleep. Nero was with difficulty persuaded
to spare his life, but finally contented himself
with banishing him from the court. The scene
must have been to some extent, ludicrous, when
these poor, bored victims of the emperor-musician,
applauding vehemently, cried out for more. Yet
the applause did not always fall in the right place,
and to obviate this difficulty, the emperor formed
a corps of <i>claquers</i> or professional applauders,
whose duty it was to lead, and direct the applause
at the proper moments. This army of <i>claquers</i>
consisted of many fashionable young men, and
five thousand commoners. They could easily be
distinguished by their elegant attire and curled
locks.</p>
<p>The system pursued was similar to that at
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
present used in some of the Parisian theatres; there
was one chief, or leader, and several deputy commanders;
the force was divided into small parties,
and mingled among the <i>bona fide</i> audience, and at
a signal from their chief, there would be applause
of the required kind.</p>
<p>Nero lavished large sums on this <i>corps</i>, and was
ever susceptible of flattery to his musical talents:
on some Alexandrians singing some verses in his
praise, he was so elated that he sent to Alexandria
for more singers and conferred many benefits
upon them.</p>
<p>Once while singing in the Roman theatre, in the
character of Orestes, the murderer of his mother
(which he certainly ought to have acted well, for
Nero killed his own mother) he came on the stage
loaded with chains, on which a young soldier
rushed on the stage to deliver him; this compliment
to the reality of his acting was specially
grateful to Nero.</p>
<p>The passion for acting and singing were with
him almost monomania; during the immense
conflagration of Rome, which he himself had
kindled, (and which burned for six days and seven
nights) he stood upon the tower of Mecaenas, and
was so impressed with the spectacle, that he
hastened to his theatre, put on the appropriate
costume, and sang &ldquo;The Destruction of Troy:&rdquo;
hence the proverb &ldquo;Nero fiddled while Rome
was burning,&rdquo; which might run more appropriately
&ldquo;Nero sang because Rome was burning,&rdquo; for it
was not callousness, as has been implied, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
rather the reverse of it; a venting of the emotions
caused by the grandeur of the spectacle.</p>
<p>That he had implicit belief in his musical powers,
there can be no manner of doubt, for he had
thoughts of possibly using it as a profession; it
had been foretold that the time should come when
he would be forsaken by all; on which he replied
to the soothsayer &ldquo;an artist can gain his livelihood
in any country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Greece at the public games, the musical
contests were still an important feature,<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> and the
cities where they were celebrated, hearing of
Nero&rsquo;s vanity in music, sent envoys to him
with several golden crowns, as tribute to his
abilities in the art; Nero was gratified beyond
measure, and said that the Greeks had the only
proper appreciation of music. He gave a sumptuous
supper to the envoys, after which they begged
that they might be permitted to hear that divine
voice; Nero, nothing loth, consented, and as
might be expected the Greeks went into ecstasies
of applause. This determined Nero to make a
musical tour through Greece, and attend the
sacred games there.</p>
<p>He started on his journey with a vast retinue,
among which were the entire force of <i>claquers</i>.
Arriving in Greece he ordered the games which
did not fall in that year, to be celebrated out of
course, and also, contrary to all precedent, established
musical contests at the Olympic games,
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
that he might have the honor of appearing in
them.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
<p>At these games, he appeared with all his
enforced boredom, none being allowed to leave
the theatre, during his performances. The
anxiety and earnestness he displayed in these
contests are almost incredible. He bribed better
artists to allow him to win, and he would address
the judges, telling them that he had made all
study and preparation, and taken all the care
necessary for so important a contest, but the issue
was in their hands, he hoped therefore they would
not regard any purely accidental mishaps. The
judges would thereupon mildly encourage the
timid contestant.</p>
<p>He always adhered strictly to the rules imposed
upon the contestants; he would never spit, or
wipe the perspiration from his forehead; once on
dropping his staff, he was greatly alarmed lest the
accident should lose him the prize, but was reassured
by one of the contestants who told him that
he was sure that the judges had not perceived the
occurrence; after the conclusion of his song, he
fell on his knees, stretching out his hands in
humble supplication for the verdict of the judges.
But when the victory was awarded to him, (as it
was always sure to be) his humility was thrown to
the winds; he then caused his own heralds to
proclaim him as the victor, and soon set up statues
of himself in the various cities, with laudatory
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
inscriptions, according to the custom of Greece.
Not content however, with this, he also caused
the statues of all previous victors to be pulled
down and thrown in the sewers.</p>
<p>He took the prize (of course) in every Greek
contest in which he participated. Competition
was freely invited, though not as freely tolerated.</p>
<p>In one of the Grecian contests a musician
entered the lists against him, who was very proud
of his skill, and could not be bought; he contested
the prize so obstinately and skilfully, that Nero&rsquo;s
soldiers also entered the contest by driving him
to the wall, and killing him in sight of the
audience;<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a> the prize was awarded to Nero.</p>
<p>His return from the tour was made with grand
pomp; on reaching Naples, he had a breach made
in the walls (according to Greek custom) and
made his triumphal entry into the city, through it.
In the same manner he entered Rome and Antium.
In Rome he arrogated to himself a full triumph,
and entered in state; all his prizes to the number
of eighteen hundred were placed in chariots, and
appeared in the procession, each one bearing an
inscription as to where and when it was won.
Statues were set up, and medals struck in honor
of his unprecedented musical success. From this
time forward, until his death he did not abate in
his musical studies or ardor.</p>
<p>Towards the close of his reign, he took much
interest in the water organ, of which we have
previously given a description.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>When his affairs were at a crisis, soon to be
followed by his death, he still gave most of his
time to his favorite study. One day when
messengers first brought to him the tidings of a
new rebellion, it is related that he spent a few
moments in consultation about these momentous
state affairs, and the rest of the day in showing
to his courtiers some new organs which he said he
intended shortly to introduce into the theatre.</p>
<p>When apprised of the fact that the legions of
Julius Vindex had mutinied, and that that able
general had also declared against him, he was
sufficiently aroused to march against him, but,
ever a maniac on the subject of music, he declared
that he intended to do nothing but appear in the
camp of the rebellious legions, and weep and sing
to them pathetic songs, which should so affect
them that they would at once return to their
allegiance; the next day after the bloodless victory
he promised to appear and sing songs of triumph
in the theatre; and he thought it well that
composers should begin to write the triumphal
odes at once.</p>
<p>In preparing for the expedition, his chief care
was not for instruments of war, but to provide
safe carriage for his musical instruments; many
wagons were filled with these, as he took along
several water organs. But the expedition never
took place, and he never had the chance of testing
the effects of pathetic music upon the Roman
legions, for all the army declared against him and
he suddenly found himself deserted by his court,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
and proscribed by the senate. In his downfall
nothing hurt him more than that his enemies
spoke of him as &ldquo;that pitiful harper,&rdquo; and he
constantly appealed to his attendants if any could
excel him in the art.</p>
<p>He at this crisis made a vow that, if his reign
continued peaceably, he would appear in the
games he intended to give in honor of his success
against the insurgents, and play the water organ,
flute and sumphonia, as well as enact a play, and
dance; but these inflictions the Roman people
were spared.</p>
<p>In one night his seemingly strong power
vanished, and he was compelled to fly for his life,
attended only by three or four persons. Having
made his way to the suburban residence of Phaon,
one of his freedmen, it was soon apparent that he
could not escape, and that he must die, either by
the hands of the infuriated Romans, or by his
own. Weeping and sobbing, while his attendants
prepared his grave, almost his last words before
his suicide were &ldquo;Alas! what an artist the world is
now to lose,&rdquo; thus in his latest moments, keeping
up that egotism and infatuation for music which
had been one of his ruling characteristics through
life.</p>
<p>The musical side of Nero&rsquo;s character is certainly
to some extent ludicrous, but there were other
and far darker sides to his hideous character.
These of course are not within our province to
dwell upon, but we have chosen to give a full
description of his musical life that the reader
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
may clearly see how little of true art, or love of
art could have existed in so oppressive an atmosphere.</p>

<br />HISTORY OF CHINESE MUSIC.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a></h2>
<p>In Brande&rsquo;s dictionary of arts and sciences,
under the head of &ldquo;Chinese music,&rdquo; the whole
fabric of Chinese music is swept away in one
short sentence, at the close of which, the
compiler curtly says,&mdash;&ldquo;We ought, perhaps to
apologize for saying <i>so much</i> of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No right minded and just reader will echo
so flippant an opinion; a nation which more than
four thousand years ago, had studied music as an
abstract science and which understood the laws of
musical proportion centuries before Pythagoras
was born, certainly deserves more than a passing
notice from the musical historian, no matter how
barbarous its present music may seem.</p>
<p>The Chinese life and character, while apparently
full of fancy, is in reality quite emptily rational
and pragmatic. In all the scientific facts relating
to music, the Chinese made early and thorough
investigations, but in that inventive inspiration
which is the soul of art, they seem to have been
deficient. They possess a very full account of
their music both of modern and ancient days.
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Their musical history teems with facts, and
anecdotes, dating back far beyond every other
nation except the Egyptian. Their literature
contains a vast number of treatises and comments
on the musical art, many of which are, however,
couched in very mystical and ambiguous language.
In the Imperial library at Pekin, there are four
hundred and eighty-two books on this subject
exclusively.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a></p>
<p>The invention of music, is ascribed by the
Chinese to supernatural beings.</p>
<p>The emperor Chi-hoang-che, who reigned in the
time of the spirits, is said to have invented the
rules of pronunciation, the written characters of
the Chinese language, and finally music.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> A
mythological character named Tong-how composed
the earliest songs.</p>
<p>Kai-tien-chi, the ninth emperor of this spiritual
dynasty, is credited with many of the earliest
songs. He also invented eight kinds of instruments
(which will be described later) the names
of which are certainly poetical enough,&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Love the people. 2. The black bird. 3.
Don&rsquo;t cut the trees. 4. Cultivate the eight
different grains. 5. Chant the celestial doctrines.
6. Celebrate the merits of the sovereign. 7.
Imitate the virtues of the earth. 8. Recall the
memory of all existing things.</p>
<p>These names were probably given to the instruments
from the special songs which each accompanied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Tcho-yung, a successor of the preceding
emperor, is said once to have listened to the songs
of the birds, while the empire was in a state of
profound peace, and their singing caused him to
invent a music which penetrated every where,
speaking to the intelligence, calming the passions
of the heart, causing perfect equilibrium in the
emotions, facilitating and improving the use of
all the senses, and prolonging the life of man.</p>
<p>The name of this music was <i>Tsie-ven</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Temperance
and mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This beautiful legend of the birds, seems almost
Greek in its poetry, but there exists yet another
mythological bird in the Chinese tales, which is
extraordinarily like the Egyptian Ph&oelig;nix. The
<i>Foang-hoang</i> was a bird whose nest and abiding-place
was wrapt up in mystery; it appeared in
China only at the birth of a good ruler, and its
coming was always a happy presage to the nation.
The Chinese mythology, so far as it relates to
music, is evidently a traditional history, and
poetically relates actual occurrences, showing
that, in all probability, their music existed, and
was highly esteemed in pre-historic times.</p>
<p>The authentic history of Chinese music may be
said to begin with Fo-hi, the first of the Ty
dynasty, and the founder of the Chinese empire.
He reigned about 2950 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a> All good qualities
seem to have been united in this beneficent ruler;
in all ways he sought to benefit his race.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>It was not as an amusement, but as a means of
popularizing his thoughts on all sciences, that he
regulated and arranged the system of music. His
first song celebrated his triumph over ignorance
and barbarism; soon after he composed the
&ldquo;Fisher&rsquo;s song&rdquo; in which he relates how he had
taught modes of fishing to the natives. He
invented the kin, a stringed instrument in the
style of the modern zither, but with cords of silk,
and in it he symbolized all manner of things.</p>
<p>He rounded the upper part to represent Heaven;
he flattened the lower part to resemble the earth;
one part of the instrument was called &ldquo;The abode
of the dragon&rdquo; (representing the breezes of
Heaven); another part was entitled &ldquo;The nest of
the Foang-hoang&rdquo; (to betoken the seasons of
the year). By means of this instrument he
could regulate his heart, and curb his passions.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who would play the Kin,&rdquo; says the
Chinese commentator, &ldquo;and draw sounds from it
which can charm, must have a grave countenance
and well regulated interior, they should pick it
lightly, and give a tone neither too high, nor
low.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
<p>Many Chinese writers attribute some of the
inventions which are credited to Fo-hi, to his wife
Niu-va, a supernatural personage who was regarded
as a holy and miraculous virgin in the Chinese
annals.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> The truth about Fo-hi seems to be that
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
he was a remarkably good man and a benefactor
to his race, and therefore many useful inventions,
and wonderful adventures are attached to his
name, which cannot be authenticated. Some
writers consider him a myth, which is scarcely a
tenable position; others have endeavored to prove
him to be neither more nor less than the Noah of
the Bible. There is little doubt that he made
improvements in Chinese music, and, by exaggeration,
was called its inventor. A Chinese writer in
giving to the invention a greater antiquity, beautifully
says &ldquo;Music had its cradle in the heart of
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chin-noung, successor of Fo-hi, was also a good
ruler; his chief works in music seem to have been
some alterations in the <i>Che</i> (a sort of <i>Kin</i>) and he
was able by his playing to turn the heart of man,
from intemperate life, to celestial truth.</p>
<p>Hoang-ti, the next emperor, had music scientifically
investigated and established natural rules to
the art. The reign of Hoang-ti is supposed to
have been about 2,600 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> In his day music
though practised, was not understood in its natural
elements.</p>
<p>The Chinese even at that day, based all other
sciences on music, and sought to make this art (in
a mystical and hyperbolical way) the foundation
of all others. The emperor therefore ordered
Ling-lun to give his attention to the development
of the laws of music. The fables on the
subject of his researches are innumerable; he
travelled to the north-western part of China and
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
took up his abode on a high mountain, near which
was a large growth of bamboos. Ling-lun took a
bamboo, which he cut between two knots; he
removed the pith, and blowing in the tube, a
sound resulted which was of the exact pitch of
the human voice when in its normal state. Not
far off was the source of the Hoang-ho, and Ling-lun
found that the tone of his tube was similar to
the sound given by the waters of that river in
bubbling from the earth; thus was discovered the
first <i>Lu</i>, (or Li) the fundamental tone.</p>
<p>Ling-lun was pursuing his investigations further,
when the Foang-hoang appeared with its mate and
perched upon a neighboring tree. The male
bird sang in six different tones, while the female
also used six, but different from the preceding.
The first note of the mystical Foang-hoang,
was precisely in unison with the reed which
Ling-lun had cut from the bamboo.</p>
<p>On ascertaining this, the fable continues, Ling-lun
cut twelve pieces of bamboo and pitched them
according to the notes of the two songsters; he
found by alternating the sounds of the male with
the female bird, that he had a chromatic scale.
The six tones of the male were called the <i>li-yang</i>
(masculine tones) the other six <i>li-yn</i> (feminine
tones), and throughout all Chinese music, the
distinction between the male and female tones of
the scale still exists. This was the first Chinese
discovery of the proportions of sound, the first
step in the science of Acoustics, and though
covered over with fable and allegory, it really
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
preceded the discoveries of Pythagoras by many
centuries; Ling-lun went back to the emperor&rsquo;s
court and there measured and fixed the pitch of
the Chinese scale forever. Bells were also made
of the official pitch, that it might easily be perpetuated.</p>
<p>Hoang-ti also had immense trumpets made
which imitated &ldquo;the voice of dragons,&rdquo; and drums
which sounded &ldquo;like thunder.&rdquo; This monarch
was as great and good in all arts and sciences,
as he was in music. He seems to have been
a Chinese &ldquo;king Alfred.&rdquo; After him, came Chao-hao,
at whose accession the Foang-hoang again
appeared, intimating thereby another prosperous
reign in this line of good and musical emperors.
Chao-hao invented the idea of marking the divisions
of the night by strokes of a drum, and also
had founded a set of twelve copper bells, to
represent the twelve months of the year. He
used all his efforts to make music popular, and
invented new modes of playing, making the <i>yang</i>
and <i>yn</i> less distinct from each other, that is
uniting the more powerful tones (male) with the
weaker (female). It is said that he first introduced
songs in honor of the ancestors, which
play a very important part in Chinese music, and
that these hymns were performed for the first
time, in honor of the amiable emperor Hoang-ti.</p>
<p>The emperors next following, all protected and
encouraged music. The first songs, that is of
a secular style, were composed about 2456 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>
At this time also, many new instruments were
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
invented, and old ones improved. With the reign
of Yao, 2357 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, the chronological record of
Chinese emperors and their doings becomes much
clearer. Under this emperor, China had a season
of great peace and prosperity. He invented the
instrument of musical stones, called the <i>king</i>,
(to be described later) and received the stones
specially adapted to its manufacture, as tribute
from various provinces.</p>
<p>Chun, who succeeded him, though of low birth
(he was nominated to the throne by Yao) continued
to advance the progress of music, and used it,
as the Greek philosophers did later, to prepare
himself for public business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to the sound of the <i>kin</i>,&rdquo; says the
Chinese historian,<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a> &ldquo;that the great emperor
Chun prepared to deal with the affairs of the
empire, and to the melody of the <i>kin</i> is due the
love and care which he constantly gave to his
people.&rdquo; Chun composed the following song,
words and music, on the above instrument; it may
be taken as a specimen of very early Chinese
improvisation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The breeze of midday brings warmth and
dispels sorrow; may it be the same with Chun;
may he be the joy and the consolation of his
people. The breeze of midday causes the grain
to grow, which is the hope of the people; even so
Oh, Chun! be thou the hope and the wealth of thy
subjects,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Chun also wrote a song in praise of agriculture.
In the year 2284 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, he established uniformity
of weight and measure, as well as a fixed diapason
throughout the empire, and endeavored to have
all the bells made in just proportions to each other.
He also caused to be composed, a melody celebrating
the nine principal virtues; it was accompanied
with dances, in nine parts and contained nine
modulations; it was named <i>Siao-chao</i> from the
instruments which the dancers held in their
hand.</p>
<p>Chun established five grand ceremonials, in
each of which music bore a part. First, a ceremony
of rejoicing, in honor of Chang-ti (the supreme
being) and of the celestial spirits. Second, a
festival in honor of the ancestors. Third, a
military celebration, in honor of the former
dissensions of the empire having given way to a
tranquil peace. Fourth, a feast dedicated to
courtesy, when the beauties of concord and
goodwill were sung. Fifth and last, a ceremony
in which the inter-dependence of man was
remembered, and the manifold blessings accruing
by mutual beneficence, chanted.</p>
<p>Chun also appointed a superintendent of music,
who was to see that the art was always exercised
in its proper direction.</p>
<p>Kouei was appointed censor, and the instructions
of the emperor to him, are full of good sense.
&ldquo;Music should follow the sense of the words.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It should be simple and unaffected.&rdquo; &ldquo;Music
is an expression of the soul of the musician;&rdquo; such
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
sentiments as these show a keen appreciation of
the art, which seems all the more singular when
we think of the peculiar music to which it relates.
The music of the time of Chun, is rapturously
eulogized by Confucius.</p>
<p>Yu, the great, only followed the example of his
predecessors in setting to music the most moral
precepts and praising virtue, in song. It may
perhaps have been this association of high
thoughts and ideas, the noble character of the
poetry, which gave music such a charm in the
eyes of the ancient Chinese. Yu made use of
some primitive instruments, in a new and very
laudable manner;<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> desirous of being easily
accessible to all his subjects, he caused to be
placed at a gate of his palace, five instruments of
percussion, which were to be struck by any
applicant, according to the nature of his business
with the emperor.</p>
<p>A large bell announced a person who desired to
complain of an injustice; a drum signified a
communication respecting the manners of the
empire; and a small bell, private or confidential
business; a <i>tam-tam</i>, a public or private misfortune;
a tambourine, an accusation of crime which
was appealed from some lower tribunal to the
adjudication of the emperor.</p>
<p>This kindly emperor, regulated what was still
deficient in music, and did it so thoroughly that
no further changes were necessary until the Hia
dynasty became extinct. The last of the above
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
mentioned dynasty was (for a change) a most
vicious emperor. Kie was, according to the
chroniclers, a sort of Mongolian Caligula, and his
memory is execrated.</p>
<p>The next dynasty, called Chang, after a prosperous
series of emperors, also ended with an
atrocious tyrant called Tchow, who invented a
luxurious style of music, and is said to have first
established the feast of lanterns. He was deprived
of throne and life by violence.</p>
<p>Ou-wang a later ruler, is chiefly celebrated for
his military music, for which he seems to have had
a <i>penchant</i> and of which he composed considerable.
One of his pieces was intended for performance
while the army formed itself in order of battle.</p>
<p>In his day, the discipline of music was very
thoroughly attended to. Every ceremony and
rite had its appropriate music attached; the musicians
had to undergo two examinations each year,
and all innovations either in composition, or in
the shaping of musical instruments was jealously
guarded against. No special features appear in
the musical history of China during the next few
reigns.</p>
<p>In the reign of Koang-tsee, a valuable treatise
on music was published, which is still highly
esteemed. At this era also were established
Mandarins of music and of the dance. At this
epoch flourished the great Kong-fu-tsee, or Confucius,
the leader of Chinese thought and philosophy.</p>
<p>This sage&rsquo;s name was simply Kong, but his
disciples added the title, <i>fu-tsee</i>, which makes the
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
meaning of the whole, Kong, the instructor, or
master. This was Latinized by the Jesuit missionaries
into Confucius. This philosopher cultivated
the study of music and seems to have esteemed
it as highly as the Greek philosophers did a
century later. He revised and arranged many of
the old books on musical ceremonies and rites.
He learnt the art in a distant province, as in his
native place music was but little known.</p>
<p>While in the kingdom of Tchi, Confucius heard
some of the ancient music of the days of Chun
performed. The effect on him was so marvellous,
that for three months he scarcely could eat, for
thinking of it. &ldquo;I should never have believed,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;that composers could reach such a
pinnacle of perfection.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a></p>
<p>It is also said that Confucius was an excellent
performer on the musical stones of the <i>king</i>.
Once while playing on this instrument a passer by
struck with the beauty of his performance,
paused to listen, and exclaimed &ldquo;surely one who
can play thus, must have his soul occupied with
great thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the later days of his wanderings, when he
was reduced to the extremity of poverty and
starvation, he sang and played as usual, showing
no signs of depression or despondency. One of
his disciples ventured a reproach, asking how he
could sing when they were all famishing; he
replied; &ldquo;the wise man seeks by music, to
strengthen the weakness of his soul, the thoughtless
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
one uses it to stifle his fears.&rdquo; The facts
relating to Confucius, his wanderings and life are
full of anecdotes relating to his extreme love of
the art, and are probably authentic. The family
of Confucius still exists in his native province,
having passed intact through sixty-eight or sixty-nine
generations; they are honored by special
privileges and distinctions and are the most notable
hereditary aristocracy of China. It may be
mentioned here, that all the philosophers and
literati of the empire were musicians as well: in
this respect strongly resembling the sages of
Greece.</p>
<p>The theatre began to progress greatly in this
era, (sixth century <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>), and one emperor was
censured for devoting too much time to his comedians,
and too little to the worthy celebration of
the ancestral feast. The arts received a severe
check when the Tchin or Tsin dynasty obtained
control of the entire realm. These were in reality
the first who united the various provinces under
one rule, and who bore, with right, the title of
Hoang, or emperor. It is from this dynasty that
China takes its name (Tchina or Tsina). One of
this set of conquerors, Tchi-chi-hoang-ti, desirous
of obliterating the memories of former glories,
which might prove prejudicial to his own, attempted,
in 245 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, a proscription of all science and
art.</p>
<p>He commanded all ancient books to be burnt,
and especially caused strict search to be made for
the books which Confucius had collected and
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
revised. Only works on agriculture and medicine
were to be spared. A large number of literary
persons who had concealed part of their books
were put to death; yet many continued to risk
their lives to preserve the fruits of ancient culture.
Books were hidden in walls of houses, in tombs,
and buried in the earth, whence they were long
afterward recovered. The emperor in proclaiming
this war on literature gave as his reason that
the ancient books did not suit that era, that they
were a hindrance to progress, that they caused
the people to neglect agriculture which was
the only substantial happiness of a nation, and
that they gave to the people liberty to censure
the sovereign, and by consequence, fostered
disobedience and rebellion. Of course in this
universal persecution, music did not fare better
than the other arts. All instruments were ordered
to be destroyed and made over after new models.
The bells which had given the standard pitch up
to that time, were melted down, and many of them
used for the purpose of founding colossal statues
to deck the entrance of the imperial palace. But,
according to La Fage,<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> it was much easier for the
musicians to evade the emperor&rsquo;s decree, and save
their instruments, than for the literati to save their
precious books. There were few instruments and
they were less rigorously sought after, and it was
an easy matter to conceal bells or the <i>kings</i>
(musical stones) by burying them in the earth
whence they could be exhumed intact at any later
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
period. Therefore in spite of the exertions of the
emperor, the ancient traditions and arts could not
be wholly extinguished; a spark still remained
from which the torch of science and art could be
re-lit.</p>
<p>It was this despotic emperor, however, who
built the <i>Wan-li-chang</i> or great wall of China,
therefore his influence upon the empire was not
wholly exerted for evil, but rather directed towards
the establishment of himself and descendants
as permanent rulers of China. The rule was
short however, for in 206 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> the <i>Han</i> dynasty
governed the empire. The first of this family,
named Kao, endeavored to repair the ravages
made in the field of learning by the Tsin despots.</p>
<p>He caused extensive search to be made in order
that the ancient pitch, division of tone, and system
of modulation might be discovered. It was
partially unavailing, for we learn that though
music was established in all its splendor under the
subsequent reign of Vow-ti, yet many writers of
that era (about 140 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span>) assert that the art of
regulating the heart by means of music, was
irretrievably lost, and that it only seemed to
inflame the baser passions.</p>
<p>In fact at this time, music was chiefly an
adjunct of the theatre, and each day brought
forth new comedies, concerts, or ballets. A terrible
scandal was created in the reign of Tching-ti
(an emperor who reigned shortly after) by that
sovereign taking one of his beautiful <i>corps de
ballet</i>, to wife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>These ballet dancers seem also to have been
talented singers, and were of similar station,
though far inferior in talents, to the <i>Hetar&aelig;</i> of
ancient Greece. In the time of the last named
ruler, there were found on the bank of a river,
sixteen ancient musical stones or <i>kings</i>, and the
fact that the sovereign esteemed this one of the
most glorious events of his reign, shows how
earnest and persistent was the endeavor to reclaim
the old school of music from oblivion.</p>
<p>Between the years <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 8, and 23, many books
relative to music were written; the Chinese, however,
assert that all of these were founded on a
false system and contained many errors. About
<span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 60, the president of the tribunal of rites
and music, made great efforts to collect the
remains of ancient knowledge, and place music
once more upon its old, pure basis. The work
written by him was highly esteemed by the literati
but unfortunately, the musicians had become used
entirely to the newer, and less pure style of music,
and were too lazy to care about learning any
new modes; therefore all manner of difficulties
were placed in the way of Pao-y&eacute;, and the reform
was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Tching-ti, <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 280, had at his court ten thousand
women, who were all proficient singers and
players. Ngai-ti, one of his successors, tried to
remedy the luxury and effeminacy which had
crept into every department of music. He
dismissed all his musicians, except those who
performed at sacred rites, or in military music
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
(these being countenanced by ancient usage) and
all the troupes of singing girls were also broken up.
The poor musicians thus thrown out of employment
numbered four hundred and forty. The
singing girls were yet more numerous.</p>
<p>These reforms seem to have been of short
duration, for almost always, after an emperor who
enthusiastically attacked these abuses, came one
who with equal fervor, protected them.</p>
<p>One sovereign, <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 289, had at his palace five
thousand actresses, and the fourth successor of
the reformer who dismissed his musicians, named
Tsin-ou-ti, although a lover of music, was also a
great lover of luxury. His greatest delight was
to enervate the officials of high rank by inviting
them to carousals which he would extend far into
the night, and when the censors remonstrated
with him on his course, he heard them patiently;
he would then invite them to dinner for the same
day, and there cause them to drink so copiously
that they had to be carried home.<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>
<p>An emperor who reigned about 503 <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> banished
comedy and music from the palace, and also
established the funeral festival in honor of Confucius,
in which sacred music played a part.</p>
<p>Tay-tsung, who ascended the throne <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 626,
was an active and thorough reformer in music as
in all other arts which needed his helping hand.
In the year 640, he turned his attention, after
having brought the empire to a state of peace, to
bringing music back to its ancient and pristine
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
glory. In pursuance of this design, he ordered
that everything relating to ancient music, books
as well as instruments, should be sent to his court.
An immense quantity of books, fragments,
memoirs, old and new instruments, etc., were
discovered and collected, which were handed over
to a committee of <i>savans</i>, whose duty it was to
retain the good, reject the bad, and systematize the
whole. Much was discovered by this means;
books were printed and the art of music received
a strong impetus; but still the Chinese held that
the full beauty of the ancient art could not be
unearthed, perhaps because they could find nothing
in it equaling their expectations: but Tay-tsung
for his efforts in the matter, was ever after
held in the highest esteem by the Chinese, who
rank him with the great and good rulers, Hoang-ti,
Yao, etc.</p>
<p>Tay-tsung also composed, or caused to be composed,
a war dance, accompanied with the
appropriate music; it was intended to inspire the
soldiers with virtue and courage, and to make
them emulate heroes.</p>
<p>Under the emperors who came immediately after,
comedy and theatrical representations flourished.
The musicians were always kept within the limits
of their caste however. A chief comedian once
permitted himself to make an allusion to state
affairs, in a play; the emperor listened to him
with much attention, (the Chinese politeness is
such that they will accord the most respectful
attention to a person whom they would like to
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
strangle,) but after the performance called the
actor aside and told him that he kept his troupe
to amuse, not to advise him, and sent the poor
fellow into exile.</p>
<p>Another time a very talented musician committed
a murder, and was sentenced to death therefor;
several officials endeavored to obtain his
pardon, and a number of musicians presented a
petition to the emperor acknowledging that the
culprit was very guilty and fully deserved his
fate, but that his talents in music could not be
replaced, and that therefore his life should be
spared. The emperor&rsquo;s reply was a worthy one,
&ldquo;you fear damage to the art of music&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but I fear damage to the laws and government of
the empire.&rdquo; The sentence was executed. One
emperor dared to raise a musician to special rank,
and thus defied the strong respect for caste, which
existed in China.</p>
<p>Y-tsung, the causer of this great scandal, had
in his service a great performer, named Li-ko-ki,
who was an especial favorite. One day when
Li-ko-ki had composed a specially agreeable song,
the emperor, without considering his profession,
gave him the post of captain of the guards. It
caused an immense excitement among the sticklers
for etiquette, for all previous emperors, when they
gave office to their musicians, first caused them
to renounce their profession, while Li-ko-ki still
continued in the practice of music; the emperor
however carried his point. Y-tsung also showered
other unusual honors upon the members of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
profession, for it was his custom to give a dozen
festivals each month, when the musical <i>corps</i>
were allowed to eat at his own table.</p>
<p>In traveling, of which he was very fond, he
rarely took along less than five hundred musicians.</p>
<p>Under the last prince of the Tang dynasty
there came many disasters upon the Chinese
empire, and the successful inroads of the Tartar
invaders, were most of all prejudicial to music; at
one time the emperor was forced to fly from the
capital, his palace was pillaged, and the musical
instruments in it, either destroyed, or carried off
to Tartary. When peace had been concluded and
tranquillity reigned again, there was an earnest
effort made to manufacture new instruments, but
in doing this, great obstacles had to be surmounted,
the models were dispersed or lost, and the
official pitch was uncertain. A great search was
made for the set of bells which represented the
authorized ancient scale, but in vain; large sums
were offered to the Tartars if they would make
restitution of those which had been carried off at
the sacking of the imperial palace, but these
savages, after long delays, replied that they could
not ascertain what had become of the captured
instruments.</p>
<p>Thus another disturbing influence was imported
into the Chinese music; but it was still as
highly-prized an art as of old, for soon after these
calamities came rulers who were passionately
devoted to it; Tchowang-song, gave two provinces
to a pair of favorite musicians; and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
subsequent emperor (<i>a la Nero</i>) took to the stage
himself, in spite of the horror of his remonstrating
censors.</p>
<p>Music and art took a new impetus under the
Song dynasty (<span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 960 to 1279), and very many
books were written, on music especially, but alas!
there was now so much uncertainty in the field
of ancient (and therefore in Chinese eyes correct)
music, that the commentators fell into the same
pit which engulfed the modern decipherers of
ancient Greek music, i. e., they speedily came to
all kinds of varying and irreconcilable conclusions.
One thing they resolved however, which was that
the bells which gave the official scale were not
correct; they therefore founded a new set, which
were so satisfactory to the emperor and his
advisers, that the former ordered his own official
bells to be given to the founders for recasting.
The musicians were very ill pleased with the new
system, although obliged to conform to it, and
yet determined that all trace of the ancient scale
should not be lost. They managed by connivance
with some officials to save a complete set. The
bells were indeed removed from the tribunal of
music and rites, but instead of being thrown into
the furnace, they were with the tacit consent of
high authorities, buried in a court-yard of the
palace, and long afterward exhumed.</p>
<p>Tsai-yu, one of the later emperors, studied
deeply to place music on a secure footing,<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> and it
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
is remarkable that his researches into the proportions
of tones, led him to the same results that
were <i>afterwards</i> discovered by the best acousticians
of Europe.</p>
<p>Kang-Hi, in the year 1678-9, worked for the art
in an extraordinary manner; he founded an
academy of music, and made his third son
president of the institution; he wrote a work,
&ldquo;The true method of the Ly-lu,&rdquo; in four books,
and had a fifth added &ldquo;<i>concerning European
music</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a> In a proclamation concerning the
diminution of the number of court-musicians,
Kang-hi says, &ldquo;Music has power to quiet the
heart, and therefore was beloved by our sages.
They also could while enjoying themselves at its
practice, benefit themselves, because the fundamental
principles of government are contained in
the art of music. But such a comparison scarcely
is suitable to virtuosity. Why, therefore, expend
money on it? I approve of the action of Ngai-Ti,
(a former emperor) in discharging them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knowledge of European music, which this
emperor attained, in opposition to all previous
custom in China, came through the Jesuit missionary
Pereira, a Portuguese by birth; and Grimaldi,
a missionary of the Propaganda. He found it
(contrary to the custom of the Chinese) quite to his
taste.<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a> He was particularly astounded by the
ability of Father Pereira to set down in notes, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
sing any melody, after a single hearing. He begged
his two guests to prepare a work containing
the elements of European harmony, and on their
completion of it, he had it printed at his palace in
a sumptuous manner, and as an especial honor, he
had his own name added to it as their coadjutor.
He now forced his musicians to learn and to play
French, German and Italian music; they did so
quite exactly, but most mechanically and with
much unwillingness, for it was contrary to all
their ideas of art or propriety. Kang-hi saw that
the effort would be useless unless he used severe
measures in enforcing his reform, and like a wise
man he yielded and allowed his performers to
return to their own beloved style of music. But
the spirit of reform was yet in him, and so far as
he was able, he introduced many innovations and
many alterations into all departments of Chinese
music.</p>
<p>He made a proclamation saying that the old
instruments though very good were quite worn
out, and that as new ones were necessary, he had
prepared a list of the ones required. One of these
<i>instruments</i>, can scarcely be called a musical one,
as it was simply a flag, which was to be displayed
during the continuance of the musical performance.</p>
<p>Kang-hi is spoken of with much rapture by the
Jesuit missionaries, for he was not only European
in his taste for music; he not only tolerated, but
greatly favored Christianity, and at one time it
was feared by his court, that he was about to
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
embrace that faith. The real secret of his intimacy
with the Catholic missionaries, seems to have been
only a great desire on his part, to acquire new
information.</p>
<p>He was greatly interested in the mechanism of
a clavichord, which the fathers brought with them
to China, and ordered two of his musicians to take
lessons from them, upon the instrument; the
pupils made very little progress, as they were
rather unwilling students.</p>
<p>It was not only in the emperor&rsquo;s court, at this
epoch, that European music began to be known;
many persons throughout all the empire, sought
to pave the way to Imperial favor by studying the
new art. The method of Father Pereira had been
sent into each province by the emperor, and the
ancient <i>Li</i> were for a time eclipsed by the <i>Do, re,
mi</i>, etc., of the &ldquo;western barbarians.&rdquo; It might
have been a permanent reform, but for the fact
that the Chinese had always been accustomed to
associate their music in a peculiar manner, with
virtue and morality; each tone represented some
moral precept, each species of the eight varieties
of sound represented to their mind some high
thought or noble virtue; it was this association of
ideas, which evoked the eulogies of Confucius,
and it was this time-honored custom which prevented
European music from obtaining any foothold
among them. When, a short time after,
Amiot endeavored to ingratiate himself with the
Mandarins by means of his music, he failed
utterly, through the same cause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>He thus relates his effort:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood music passably well; I played
the traverse flute and the clavichord; I used all
these little talents to make myself welcome to the
Chinese. On different occasions during the first
years of my stay in Pekin, I never failed to
endeavor to convince those who heard me, that
our music, excelled that of their own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to be remembered that these were educated
persons, able to compare and to judge; persons of
the first rank, who honoring the French missionaries
with their kindness, came often to their
abode to entertain themselves with them, with
various matters relative to the sciences or arts
cultivated in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cyclops,&rdquo; &ldquo;The savages,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> the most
beautiful sonatas, the most melodious airs of the
flute, none of these made any impression on the
Chinese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw upon their countenances only a cold and
vacant look, which announced to me that I had
not touched them in the least. One day I asked
them how they liked our music, and begged that
they would tell me frankly what they thought.
They answered in their politest way, that <i>our
melodies were not made for their ears, nor their
ears for our melodies</i>, it was not therefore surprising,
they could not find beauties in our melodies,
as they could in their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The melodies of our music,&rdquo; said a distinguished
doctor (in the service of his majesty,
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
the emperor); &ldquo;the melodies of our music pass
from the ear to the heart, and from the heart to
the soul. We feel them, and we understand them;
those which you have just played, have no such
effect upon us. The airs of our ancient music
were something quite different; one needed but
to hear them, to be ravished with them. Our
books give to them the most pompous eulogies;
but they tell us at the same time, that we have, in
a great measure, lost the excellent method by
which the ancients produced such marvellous
effects.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a> It is interesting to place these remarks
beside the reiterated opinion of many writers that
the Chinese music is not worthy of being called
&ldquo;music&rdquo; at all; and then to turn to that most
proper definition of the art,&mdash;&ldquo;Music is the art of
moving the feelings by combinations of sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same obstacles exist to-day against change
in the music of the Chinese, as in the days of
Kang-hi.</p>
<p>This emperor, in his later days added to the
long list of his musical efforts, a volume treating
of dances, and also a collection of the most
celebrated ancient songs. The missionary who
mentions this latter work,<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a> assures us that he
dares not translate it, lest he should be accused of
placing the sentiments of the most noble psalms
in the mouth of the Chinese.</p>
<p>During Kang-hi&rsquo;s reign the flute became quite
fashionable in China, the people becoming
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
infatuated with it; Kang-hi himself became proficient
in its use, but on finding, later, that he had
not benefited himself in any way by its use he
gave up the practice.</p>
<p>Young-tching, his successor, published new
rules for music and assigned a special music in
honor of agriculture and husbandry, which was to
be performed each year. He did not take to the
Jesuits as kindly as his predecessor, for from <span class="smaller">A. D.</span>
1724 to 1732 he was busily engaged in expelling
them from China.</p>
<p>Khian-long, his son, succeeded him in 1736.
There is nothing remarkable in the history of
Chinese music from his day to the present time.</p>
<p>Lord Macartney&rsquo;s embassy (1793) took place
during the long reign of this emperor. Many
persons were attracted to the embassy&rsquo;s rooms by
the European band which each evening gave a
concert. Among the most assiduous of these
visitors was the chief of the emperor&rsquo;s orchestra;
charmed with the sound of some of their instruments,
yet absolutely refusing to accept of them
as a present, he sent several painters to take
designs of them on paper. These artists laid
clarinets, flutes, bassoons, etc., on immense
sheets of paper, on which they traced the exact
shape and size of each, while underneath they
wrote remarks giving the exact dimensions of
each aperture, valve and tube.</p>
<p>The chief announced his determination of making
similar instruments from these models, but in
different proportions, which he proposed to fix for
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
himself. The result of the experiment is unknown.</p>
<p>The later emperors have all had long reigns, and
left music in <i>status quo</i>, the last emperor Hien-fung
being only remarkable for his constant drunkenness.
Let us now examine more minutely the
order of music which has inspired such disgust to
European ears, and such rapture to the Chinese
from the earliest ages down to the present time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />CHINESE MUSIC AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</h2>
<p>The Chinese have from the very earliest times
divided musical sounds into eight classes, and
imagined that in order to produce them, nature
had formed eight kinds of sonorous bodies. They
divided them as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The sound of skin, produced from the
tanned skin, or parchment of various animals.
2. The sound of stone. 3. Of metal. 4. Of
baked clay. 5. Of silk, used in the form of
strings as we use cat-gut, or wire. 6. Of wood,
used often in instruments of percussion. 7. Of
bamboo, used in flutes. 8. Of calabash, a species
of gourd, out of which a peculiarly constructed
instrument was manufactured.</p>
<p>Of the skins of animals, many different instruments
are made, all of which may be designated
under the general name of drums, but the Chinese
possess various kinds of drums of all shapes
and sizes.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> The most ancient variety of these
was the <i>Tou-kou</i>, which signifies earth drum, so
called because its body was made of baked clay,
over each end of which was drawn the skin. An
instrument of this description was both fragile
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
and unwieldy; its disadvantages soon caused the
clay to be replaced by wood, out of which all
subsequent drums were made, the size and shape
being varied according to the uses for which they
were destined. Nothing is said in the ancient
writings as to what varieties of wood were used
in the manufacture of the earliest drums, but
tradition has it, that at first the wood of the cedar
and mulberry, as also sandal wood, were the most
used.</p>
<p>The Chinese possess eight kinds of drums. 1.
The <i>tsou-kou</i>, which had the shape of a barrel,
and was fixed upon a pole which ran through its
body. 2. The Yn-kou, similar to the above, but
the body more elongated, and the staff or pole
which supported it usually thrust into the
earth to keep it firmly in position, while that of
the tsou-kou stood upon a cross piece at its base.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a>
3. A variety of the <i>tsou-kou</i> called hiuen-kou, of
very large size; on each side of this drum is
attached a small drum, in shape like a kitchen
pot, one of which is to be struck lightly, the other
heavily. 4. The kin-kou, another keg-shaped
drum mounted upon a pedestal; it is about six
feet long, and six feet in diameter. It receives
different names according to the way it is
decorated; thus, if it bears on its case paintings
of storms, it would be called lei-kou; but if it is
ornamented with birds of good omen, such as the
<i>foang-hoang</i>, or white swans, it is called <i>lou-kou</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
5. The great tao-kou, which is still used to give
the signal for the commencement of a song, is
about one foot in length and diameter. 6. The
little tao-kou, a cross between a drum and a baby&rsquo;s
rattle, is about seven inches long, mounted upon
a stick, and through the centre of its case a string
is passed; at each end of this string are knots;
when this drum is played, the performer twirls it
about rapidly, the knots fly against the skin, and
produce a sort of rattle or drumming. This drum
is used to show the completion of a verse or division
of any musical composition. It is also used in
funeral processions and at commemorative
ceremonies.<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> 7. The <i>ya-kou</i>, a small drum which
is filled with rice grains. The skin of this drum
is not only tanned but is boiled afterwards in pure
water. The sound of this instrument is soft and
pleasant. 8. The <i>po-sou</i> is a drum of cylindrical
shape, and is placed upon a small table; it is played
sitting; in all other respects it is like the <i>ya-kou</i>.</p>
<p>These are the eight varieties of drums known
to the Chinese; many of them are still in use;
there are also some varieties of military drums
which do not differ much from the preceding.</p>
<p>It is customary to cover not only the case, but
the faces and sticks of the drums with paintings.</p>
<p>Drums are used in China to give the hour at
night, to announce persons desiring audience, at
some palaces, and for many other purposes as well
as for music. The Chinese also sometimes muffle
their drums (in all religious ceremonies which
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
take place in presence of the emperor) effecting
this not in our manner, but by covering the instrument
with ornamented draperies of cloth, which
absorb part of the sound.</p>
<h3 id="c15">OF THE SOUND OF STONE.</h3>
<p>The custom of making a systematic use of
stone, in music, is peculiarly a Chinese institution.
In the <i>Chouking</i>, one of the most ancient
of Chinese chronicles, we read that already in the
almost mythological days of Yao and Chun,
the Chinese had observed that certain kinds of
stone were adapted to giving out musical sounds,
and that these tones occupied the place between
the sound of metal and of wood, being less
sharp and penetrating than the former, and more
sonorous than the latter, and more brilliant and
sweet than either.</p>
<p>Even in those days they carved and shaped the
stones, in order to extract from them the regular
notes of their scale, and made instruments of
them which even to-day are used in China, and
are named <i>king</i>.</p>
<p>These musical stones were highly valued, and
received as tribute as early as 2250 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> Those
found on the surface of the earth, and near the
banks of the rivers, were most esteemed, as it
was supposed that their exposure gave clearness
and purity to their tone.</p>
<p>These stones, called <i>Yu</i>, are found near the
mountain streams and torrents of Yun-nan.
They are of extreme hardness and are polished in
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
the same manner as agate and precious stones.
Large specimens are extremely rare; those which
Amiot saw at the Imperial palace, were three feet
by one foot eight inches in size, but they were
considered unique.</p>
<p>Their weight (specific gravity) is also very
wonderful, for stones which seem to be not too
heavy a burden for one man, require four men to
move them.<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a> Those in the palace were of many
colors, milk-white, sky-blue, indigo-blue, yellow,
orange, pale green, sea-green, red and gray.
Those most esteemed were of a single color
throughout, though when five colors blended, it
was considered a valuable specimen. It may be
mentioned in this connection that the number five
seems to acquire a mystical significance among
the Chinese, for their music has five principal
tones, they recognize five elements, five virtues,
five senses, five duties, and five principal ceremonies.<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></p>
<p>Some of these stones resemble marble, and
others seem to be petrifactions of some sort. We
are unaware whether those belonging to the
emperor have been examined by any recent
geologist. The Duke de Chaulnes in the last
century, came to the conclusion that the stone
was marble, but that its organization differed in
some respects from ours; and that iron entered
into its composition.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to complete an octave with
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
the best of musical stones. In carving and ornamentation
they require most skillful manipulation
lest the pitch be endangered.</p>
<p>Under the Han dynasty a most harmonious <i>king</i>
was presented to the emperor. The designs
traced upon the stones were not quite satisfactory
to that potentate; on endeavoring to alter slightly
the fashion of the stones, the pitch of the instrument
was irrevocably lost, and its harmony
destroyed forever.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a> The <i>king</i> has from time
immemorial been played by striking the stones
with a stick or mallet of hard wood. The skill of
the player is shown in the degree of shading he
can impart to the tones, by varying the force of
his blows. Of all instruments, the Chinese claim
that the <i>king</i> blends best with the human voice.
The entire Chinese chronicles teem with praises of
this peculiar instrument. Confucius was thrown
into ecstatic bliss on hearing it for the first time.
The musical work entitled <i>Li-ki</i> says: &ldquo;the harmonious
sound of the <i>king</i> invites the sage to think
of the end of life. When he hears it, he thinks
of death, and fortifies himself in his love of duty.&rdquo;
But this passage refers only to the great <i>king</i>
made of <i>Yu</i> (the finest melodious stones), which
was only played on great religious occasions; it is
not singular that this instrument should be
associated with religious thoughts. There were
other kinds of <i>kings</i> which were used on lesser
occasions. In the imperial palace were several of
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
smaller size, called <i>pien-king</i>, which were composed
of sixteen stones each. The <i>tse-king</i> consisted of
one large stone, and is used to give the pitch to
other instruments, to signalize the commencement
of a tune, and according to some writers, was
anciently used to beat the time throughout a
composition.</p>
<p>The shape of the stones is much like a carpenter&rsquo;s
square; and if sixteen of these tools were
suspended from a clothes horse, the shape at
least of the <i>king</i> would be attained; but in the
most ancient specimens the stones are shaped
with much more diversity, fishes, bats, and other
quaint forms appearing with much ingenuity in
the different pieces. The only modern instrument
of similar style to the <i>king</i>, which is known to
American readers, is the glass-harmonica, where
short strips of glass, being struck by a mallet, give
out a melodious, but not very manageable tone,
and any person performing on the <i>musical glasses</i>,
not by friction, but by percussion, can give a fair
representation of the music of the favorite instrument
of China.</p>
<h3 id="c16">OF THE SOUND OF METAL.</h3>
<p>Bells have been in China from the earliest ages
the most esteemed of instruments. At first their
duty was to be a sort of tuning fork; one bell
being made for chief or fundamental tone, and
eleven others giving the various semitones. These
bells were much different from our church and
tower bells; they rather resemble large hand bells,
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
but were of somewhat greater weight. The
smallest bells were used in an instrument called
<i>Pien-tchoung</i>, which consisted of sixteen of them,
tuned in unison with the sixteen stones of the
king. We have already spoken of the efforts
made to suppress the bells, and through them, the
authentic pitch of Chinese music, by one of the
conquering emperors.</p>
<h3 id="c17">OF THE SOUND OF BAKED CLAY.</h3>
<p>Of this the Chinese made a deep-toned whistle,
with five to seven apertures called <i>Hiuen</i>. This
was probably the primitive instrument in China,
as it is mentioned as already existing before the
reign of Hoang-ty, about 2637 <span class="smaller">B. C.</span> An ancient
Chinese Dictionary speaks of the two varieties of
these, saying, &ldquo;the larger hiuen should be of the
size of a goose egg, the smaller, of that of a
hen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c18">OF THE SOUND OF SILK.</h3>
<p>Under this head come all Chinese stringed
instruments, for where we use catgut, the celestials
use silken cords. Even in the semi-mythical
age of Fo-hi, they made a simple instrument by
extending threads of silk upon a board of light
wood. Little by little the board was shaped to its
purpose better; gradually also, the strings were
laid with more precision and exactness, and the
cords gave out tones deep or high, according to
the tension to which they were subjected, or the
number of threads of which they were composed;
thus by insensible degrees came into existence
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
the <i>kin</i>, the leading stringed instrument of the
Chinese empire. In size, it is larger than all
Eastern stringed instruments except the harp, its
length being five feet, six inches. It has seven
cords which are tuned as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="smaller">DO, RE, FA, SOL, LA, DO, RE,</span></p>
</div>
<p>giving it only five tones. The pentatonic character
of this instrument is observable in all Chinese
music, and causes a slight resemblance between
that music and the Scotch. There are several
varieties of the <i>kin</i>. The large, medium, and
small, only differ in their size, and have each
seven cords, but there is a much larger instrument
of the same species, which is called the <i>che</i>, which
has twenty-five strings, and is nine feet long; it
is said that in ancient days there were <i>ches</i> made
which had fifty strings.</p>
<p>Both the <i>che</i> and <i>kin</i> were, in true Chinese
fashion, made to convey numberless morals and
symbols. The breezes of Heaven, the four seasons,
the five elements, and the universe were all
in some manner dragged into the formation of
these instruments. The <i>kin</i> represented life, the
<i>che</i> death, and before performing upon either, the
player went through certain ceremonies to fit
himself for the task, and lighted some perfumed
tapers, which were kept burning throughout the
performance. To perform on the <i>kin</i>, the Chinese
held that one must be well advanced in wisdom
and sagacity. Of the <i>che</i>, there exist four different
kinds, the great, medium, small and very small;
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
all these differ in size but not in their number
of strings, each possessing twenty-five. Amiot<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a>
found the <i>che</i> to be a more agreeable instrument
than any known in Europe in his day (1750 circa),
as the softer sounds of the silken cords were preferable
to the metallic sound of the wires of the
clavichord.</p>
<p>We have no instrument in our music which
corresponds to the <i>kin</i>, or <i>che</i>; but the zither if
trebled in length, and strung with silk instead of
wire would give a very exact idea of this finest of
Chinese instruments.</p>
<h3 id="c19">THE SOUND OF WOOD.</h3>
<p>The Chinese have from remotest antiquity, used
wooden instruments of percussion; it is most
natural that the earliest of instruments used
by man, should have been of wood, but it is also
natural that most nations should have laid aside
these primitive and toneless instruments. Not so
the Chinese however; their wooden instruments
are still used as they were four thousand years ago;
for the historians date their invention from the
mysterious reign of Fo-hi.</p>
<p>These instruments are the <i>tchu</i>, the <i>ou</i>, and the
<i>tchung-tou</i>, all of which celebrate and typify the
most profound moral precepts, <i>a la Chinois</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>tchu</i> is a plain wooden box, about a foot
and a half deep, in which a hammer is fastened;
by introducing the hand into a small aperture,
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
made for that purpose in the side of the instrument,
the hammer is agitated, and swaying from
side to side, produces a sort of tattoo on both
sides of the box. This scarcely can be called
<i>music</i> for it is doubtful if the sound is even
rhythmic; but it is not the sound alone which
captivates the Chinese ear, the symbol attached to
it moves the Chinese heart, for the sages assure
us that this clatter represents (in some mysterious
way) the advantages of the social intercourse of
men, and the mutual benefits of society. The
<i>tchu</i> is placed at the <i>north-east</i> of the other instruments
and is played at the commencement of a
composition.</p>
<p>The <i>ou</i> is an image of a sleeping tiger, and is a
symbol of the power which man has over all other
creatures. It is placed at the <i>north-west</i> of the
other instruments, and is played at the close of a
piece of music. Along the back of this image is
a row of pegs; when the instrument is well played,
six tones can be extracted from these wooden
pegs, but usually the performance is ended by the
player running the stick, by which the pegs are
struck, swiftly along the whole row, and finishing
with a couple of blows upon the tiger&rsquo;s head.
This is repeated three times as <i>finale</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>tchung-tou</i> cannot really be classed among
musical instruments, since they are only the
wooden plates upon which music was sometimes
written; their moral is obvious; they bring back
to memory the great invention of communication
by means of written characters. But they also
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
participate somewhat in the general clatter produced
by the other wooden instruments; they are
about fourteen inches long, and one inch wide,
are twelve in number, to commemorate the twelve
sounds of the scale, and serve to beat the measure
of the music, by being struck lightly against the
palm of the left hand. The twelve pieces are
attached to each other by means of cords.</p>
<p>There is besides, a military instrument of wood
(though also scarcely to be classed as musical)
which is carved in the form of a fish, and is
suspended in front of the general&rsquo;s tent. When
any person requires to see that official, he has but
to strike this fish with two wooden sticks which
are lying near by, and the audience is immediately
granted; so greatly have the Chinese reduced
language to various musical sounds, that by the
mode of striking with the sticks, the applicant
intimates, in a general manner, concerning what
description of business the audience is requested.</p>
<p>There also exist in China a few other instruments
of wood, from which regular series of tones
can be produced, and upon which tunes can be
played, but these latter seem not to be really
Chinese in their origin, and are spoken of by the
musical commentators of the country, as &ldquo;strange
instruments which have come into use in China.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c20">THE SOUND OF BAMBOO.</h3>
<p>It seems, at first sight, as if this class of instruments
should be placed under the head of &ldquo;wood;&rdquo;
but the Chinese draw a very wide distinction
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
between wood and bamboo, holding the latter in
especial esteem, as being of all vegetation, the
most useful to man; and they claim that nature in
producing it, fitted it especially to the art of
music. It is true that it required no great inventive
faculty to extract tones from the hollow
sticks of bamboo, and it is possible that music
drawn from the bamboo was the earliest of the
Chinese empire. One of the most famed of
instruments made of this reed, is called the <i>Koan-tsee</i>.
This is simply a set of pan&rsquo;s pipes, arranged
according to Chinese tonality; the superior (male)
tones, called <i>yang</i> being given to one instrument,
and the inferior (female) called <i>yn</i> to another, so
that to have a melody in any modulations performed,
two instruments and two musicians were
required. This arrangement was too awkward to
last forever; finally the two instruments were
united in one, and instead of being weakly bound
together by cord, as were the twelve pipes of the
<i>koan-tsee</i>, two strips of thin board held the tubes
in place; the number of pipes was also increased
from twelve, to sixteen, and the new instrument
called the <i>siao</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a></p>
<p>Of course the Chinese possess flutes, as well as
other instruments of bamboo. The <i>yo</i> and <i>ty</i> are
in some respects similar to our flutes, save that
they have usually but three holes, and the tones
have therefore to be produced by a more skillful
use of the breath than is required on the European
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
flute. An instrument of the flute family the use
of which has become somewhat obsolete, is the
<i>tche</i>. This is different from all other flutes, and
is now but little played in China. The <i>embouchure</i>
is exactly in the middle, both ends are stopped,
and on each side of the <i>embouchure</i> are three
holes. It was considered the most difficult of all
flutes to play.</p>
<h3 id="c21">THE SOUND OF CALABASH.</h3>
<p>The calabash is a gourd of pumpkin shape, but
somewhat smaller. In the instrument which we
are about to describe, we shall see that the calabash
(called <i>pao</i> by the Chinese) really emits no
sound, but serves only as an air reservoir for one
of the most wonderful instruments of ancient
times. The <i>cheng</i>, which is the only instrument
in which the calabash is used, is in fact a <i>portable
organ</i>, and when we consider that this intricate
instrument was invented about four thousand
years ago, we are lost in astonishment that the
invention did not lead to greater results; yet the
Chinese have frequently, in other sciences as well,
advanced to the threshold of great discoveries.</p>
<p>We will not detail to the reader, all the legends,
symbols, and mythology attached to the <i>cheng</i>; suffice
it to say that animal, mineral and vegetable
nature is represented by it, and that to each part of it
is appended some mystical meaning. The gourd is
pierced and cleaned, and an aperture made for
the air to enter, then the ends of from thirteen to
twenty-four pipes of bamboo are inserted into as
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
many holes cut in the gourd; each of these pipes
contains in it a tongue of copper or gold, the
vibration of which causes the sound; beneath
this is a hole cut in the bamboo, through which
aperture the air rushes without giving any sound,
but when the hole is stopped by pressing a finger
upon it, the air having no other outlet, is forced
up the pipe, and striking the metallic tongue,
gives out an agreeable reed sound. A curved
mouth-piece through which the performer is to
blow, is introduced at the centre of the gourd.
The <i>cheng</i> contains all the elements of the reed
organ, and it would be a simple matter to produce
harmonies with it, and yet with this instrument in
the world for four thousand years, it remained
for moderns (comparatively speaking,) to discover
the art of combining different sounds; but the
invention of so well-conceived a reed instrument
in such remote ages, certainly entitles the ancient
Chinese to the utmost respect of their unconscious
imitators, the Europeans.</p>
<h3 id="c22">MISCELLANEOUS INSTRUMENTS.</h3>
<p>There exist in China, some instruments which
are not classed with either of the above eight
kinds of tone. These we have thought best to
group under the head of &ldquo;miscellaneous,&rdquo; though
they are quite as important as any of the preceding,
except perhaps, the <i>king</i>, <i>cheng</i>, and <i>kin</i>.
The Chinese have long possessed a peculiar variety
of fiddle, which at first appearance much resembles
a mallet with cords stretched from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
head to the handle; but the head of this primitive
fiddle is hollow, and holds a sounding board,
though a very small one, of gazelle&rsquo;s skin. The
sounds drawn from this oriental fiddle are said to
set one&rsquo;s teeth on edge; it is said to be the most
execrable of all Chinese instruments. The invention
of this fiddle cannot be ascribed to the
Chinese, as it probably came from India originally.
There also exist several Chinese instruments of a
kind much resembling our guitars or banjos.
The number of strings on these are variable.<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a></p>
<p>From remote antiquity, the Chinese have
understood the ductility of metal, and it is not
surprising that the trumpet is, with them, one of
the oldest of instruments. These trumpets are
made of all sizes and most peculiar shapes.<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a> It
appears that they are intended to give but two
tones each, although being made of all sizes, a
complete scale can be arranged by collecting ten
or twelve of them. The music of them (as with
the ancient Greeks) is judged only by the degree
of loudness with which it is given, and even when
several play together, there is no attempt at
harmony, but each trumpeter repeats his two
notes with vigor and persistency; the result is
said to be most distressing to European ears.
Yet it is possible to extract beautiful music even
from single-toned trumpets, for in Russia, most
exquisite melodies are rendered by bands of
trumpeters, each of whom performs but one
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
note, in the same manner as troupes of bell-ringers
give whole pieces of music with small hand bells.</p>
<p>Tom-toms and gongs also appear frequently in
the music of the empire; these are chiefly used to
keep the time of the orchestra; there is also
an instrument analogous to these, which consists
of a series of metal basins, (usually of
copper) from eight to ten in number, set
in a frame. The whole instrument looks not
unlike a cooking range with all its utensils. These
basins are struck with a mallet, and produce
sounds similar to, but less harsh than the gongs.
The name of this unique apparatus is <i>yin-lo</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c23">THE SOUND OF THE VOICE.</h3>
<p>Singular to relate, the Chinese have in their
classification of eight musical sounds, utterly
omitted to make any mention of the sound of the
human voice. In all their great ceremonies,
such as hymns of praise to Heaven, and commemoration
of the ancestors, songs are used, but never,
on these occasions are female voices allowed. In
fact, the female, in music, occupies about the
same position in China, as she once did in ancient
Greece; the better class of respectable matrons
do not study any art whatever; and the less
respectable and the slaves, are allowed to perfect
themselves in many arts of pleasing, among which
a study of the lower branches of music, as well as
a certain degree of general education is included.
A slave is far more marketable with musical
talents than without. But women always participated
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
in orchestral music, and in a manner rather
astonishing to us; they sometimes played the
wind instruments. The singular custom of allowing
the weaker sex to play the part requiring the
strongest lungs was quite universal among ancient
nations, and the Chinese may be regarded as a
nation who have kept their ancient usages almost
intact. It is seldom however, that women assist
in any concerts whatever; the instrumental playing
as well as the singing being almost always
wholly rendered by men.</p>
<p>Few travellers have heard a musical Chinese
lady sing, and those who have enjoyed this rare
event, say it is the most torturing of all Chinese
music; from the <i>nose</i> and throat issue the most
droning and hideous sounds, and they seem to pile
Ossa upon Pelion in the way of unnatural tones.</p>
<p>Although the female voice is therefore lacking
in the concerted music of this singular people,
the parts sometimes run very high for male voice
and the singers for these parts are procured in the
same manner in which the papal choir in the last
century, procured its highest male voices.<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a></p>
<p>Of the divisions of the vocal parts in singing,
very little is as yet known, although many books
must exist upon the subject, which have hitherto
been inaccessible to foreigners. The natural
voice of the Chinese is rather high, and very high
tenors are not at all rare in the empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The voice in China is trained to much flexibility
by the exigencies of the language, for the Chinese
is in one sense, the most musical of languages, as
a word acquires half a dozen different significations
according to the pitch of voice, or inflection
with which it is pronounced.</p>
<p>The number of different words in the whole
Chinese tongue does not exceed three hundred
and fifty; all the additional ones, are simply
variations of these by lowering, or raising the
voice. This leads the foreigner into endless
complications and misunderstandings; for example,
the word <i>tchu</i> pronounced clearly with the
vowel of medium length, means &ldquo;master,&rdquo; but
by extending the vowel a trifle it signifies &ldquo;hog;&rdquo;
it also means &ldquo;column,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cookery.&rdquo; The
syllable &ldquo;<i>po</i>&rdquo; has eleven different meanings&mdash;&ldquo;glass,&rdquo;
&ldquo;boil,&rdquo; &ldquo;captive,&rdquo; &ldquo;prepare,&rdquo; etc.,
each of which must be pronounced with a different
pitch and inflection.<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a> Among the original words
are some which decidedly are taken from nature,
such as &ldquo;<i>tchung</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;bell,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>miaou</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;cat,&rdquo;
but these are very few.</p>
<p>Some authors have endeavored to show from
these facts, that the Chinese is in all respects
a musical language, but this can hardly be
conceded, for the inflections spoken of, are so
slight as to escape the European ear, which surely
would not be the case if they were really musical
notes, since we have seen that Father Pereira, in
the last century, was able to note down at first
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
hearing, and imitate any Chinese song. The
people in conversation give the voice a flute-like
sound, but this has scarcely arisen from any
special musical quality in the language itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />CHINESE MUSICAL COMPOSITIONS AND CEREMONIES.</h2>
<p>The most ancient music with the Chinese as
with all people, seems to have consisted of
hymns to the Deity, rendering thanks to Him
for the benefits given to man in the various
departments of labor. These were divided
according to the class which used them, into
agricultural, military, piscatorial, etc. Very
soon after these, there came into existence that
reverential ceremony in memory of the ancestors,
which is so characteristically Chinese, and which
became, of all their festivals, the most important
and the most musical.</p>
<p>This ceremonial as conducted by the emperor is
as follows. In the vestibule of the hall are
retainers who bear a particular kind of standards,
which show that the coming of the sovereign is
expected. Here also are seen bells, drums, and
musicians, as well as officers of the guards, all
standing in symmetrical figure, and motionless in
their position. On entering the hall one sees,
right and left, the performers on the <i>cheng</i> and
<i>king</i>, and the minor instruments, all arranged in
their proper order. In the middle are placed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
dancers, in uniform and each holding in hand the
instrument which they are to use in their evolutions.
Near the end are placed the players of the
<i>che</i> and <i>kin</i> as well as the performers on the style
of drum called the <i>po-sou</i>, and the singers.
Finally, at the lower end of the hall are seen the
representations of the ancestors themselves, either
in the form of portraits, or of simple tablets
bearing the name of each. Before these is a table
on which stand flowers and libations. Each performer
and instrument is placed in an allotted
position. For example, the bell is at the south-west,
the <i>cheng</i> at the north-west, the drum at the
south-east, the flute at the north-east, and the
table at the south; and this arrangement is never
departed from.</p>
<p>When the signal announcing the approach of
the emperor is heard, the singers and musicians,
slowly and with great majesty, begin the hymn of
honor, while the emperor, with stately and dignified
tread, advances to the table at the south of
the hall.<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a> It is a moment of holy awe (somewhat
akin to the instant when the Host is elevated in
Catholic churches) for the spirits of the departed
are supposed at this time to come down from
Heaven to their descendants. We give here an
English paraphrase of the words of part of this
hymn, which we have translated from the version
of Father Amiot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>

<p class="t0">And need not feel remorse.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>In giving this, necessarily weak, translation of
the opening part of the hymn, we have endeavored
to preserve the short Iambics of the Chinese
version; but in the Chinese there are only eight
lines to the first division, therefore four lines of
the translation correspond to one of the original.
After the chorus has sung as far as this, which is
only an exordium, or manner of worthily preparing
for the following exercises, the emperor
prostrates himself three times, touching his forehead
to the earth each time, and then taking
the libations, offers them up to the departed:
meanwhile the chorus sing the second part of the
hymn, still in the name of the emperor.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a> In this
he again alludes <i>per</i> chorus, to his noble descent,
and thanks them for leaving their abode of bliss
to visit him, and humbly prostrated, begs to render
homage to them, and entreats that they will
accept the libations offered, as a testimonial of
profound respect and perfect love.<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a> After offering
these, the emperor prostrates himself nine
times to the earth, and then resumes his position
in front of the table, while the chorus sing the
third part of the hymn. During this final division
of the music, the spirits which descended at the
first part are supposed to be reascending to
Heaven. In the third part the emperor (still by
proxy) states how mean and pitiful he feels, after
such illustrious predecessors, and tells how heavy
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
the burdens of state are to him, and thanks his
ancestors for their spiritual assistance. He concludes
with the statement that he can do very
little to testify his appreciation of all their benefits,
but what he is able to do he has done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times with respect, have I offered the
triple sacrifice; not being able to do more, my
vows are satisfied.&rdquo; The hymn being finished,
the emperor retires with his ministers and <i>cortege</i>
in the same order in which they entered the hall.
The music continues until he has reached his own
apartments. Dancers participate in this ceremony
and are sumptuously clad and really assume a <i>role</i>
of much importance. As with the ancient Greeks
and Romans, they are not to be thought of as
being jumpers or twirlers; they express by their
motions the sentiments which actuate the emperor
as he eulogizes his ancestors, expresses his own
unworthiness, his gratitude, pride, and other
emotions. The music of this august ceremonial,
is entirely written in whole notes, without any
change of rhythm whatever. It is rather monotonous
than distressing to our ears.</p>
<p>This is not the case with other vocal compositions
of the Chinese; nearly all travellers agree
in saying that their music, in this branch especially,
resembles far more the cries of the nocturnal cat
than the human voice. The composers seem to
have an aversion to progression by degrees, in
their songs, and a decided <i>penchant</i> for long skips.
We do not intend a slur upon the Scotch music
when we say that there are points of resemblance
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
between the Chinese music and the former. Some
Chinese airs (given by Irwin and Barrow<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a>) show
this resemblance startlingly. Although the Chinese
understand the division of the chromatic scale
perfectly well, yet they never use it; five tones
are all they ordinarily employ; these are</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="smaller">FA, SOL, LA, DO, RE,</span></p>
</div>
<p>omitting even the semitone of our diatonic scale.
Some of their most eminent theorists have maintained
that the notes pienkoung (si) and pienche
(mi) are as useless to music as a sixth finger
would be to the hand.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the semitone progression
is not used in China, and though known, is
universally proscribed and avoided; it is this which
occasions the peculiarities of Chinese music. On
this subject we cannot refrain from re-quoting an
article on Chinese music, which appeared in the
&ldquo;China Mail,&rdquo; a Hong-Kong newspaper, in 1845.<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;One possessed of a musical ear, and at all
conversant with the musical art, cannot fail, on his
arrival in this country, to be struck with the
peculiarities of what is esteemed music here.
He notices at once, that the characteristics of
western melody, are almost wholly wanting.
Nearly every note seems out of place, and there
is neither beginning, middle nor end, to the airs
he listens to. Instead of a theme which is
developed and embellished by the whole performance,
he hears a hurry-skurry of notes, apparently
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
flung together without link or affinity; and
even the confusion of sounds to make it worse,
instead of finishing in a quiescing cadence, passes
beyond what is looked for as the last note, and
sometimes ends with what we should call a flatted
keynote, leaving the listeners in a most uncomfortable
state of suspense and uncertainty as to what
may follow. For my own part, I have not been
able as yet to discover whether the Chinese
recognise such a thing as a keynote among the
parts of song, or whether their composers begin,
continue, and end their tunes <i>ad libitum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have inserted the above that the reader may
judge how strongly the music distresses the
musical European at first hearing; but it is also
not to be forgotten that the Eastern, (Hindoo and
Arabian) music had a similar effect upon persons
who a year later were obliged to acknowledge that
they had begun to find beauty, and take pleasure
in it.</p>
<p>Of other court musical ceremonies, the emperor&rsquo;s
birthday, the harvest sacrifice, the feast of
agriculture, and the fifteenth day of the first
moon, are the most important. The first occasion
is described by Lord Macartney, who heard it on
the 17th of September, 1793. It began with a slow
majestic sound of deep-toned bells and muffled
drums, in the distance. This impressive music
was occasionally interrupted by sudden pauses;
with equal suddenness the whole force of singers
and instrumentalists would burst out with their
utmost strength, while the entire court bowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
their faces to the earth as often as the refrain was
sung:&mdash;&ldquo;Bow down your heads ye inhabitants of
the earth, bow down your heads before the great
Kien-long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emperor was not visible during these
ceremonies.</p>
<p>Among the secular pieces, collected by Amiot,
is one which demands especial notice; it is an
instrumental representation of a battle. It will
be recollected that fifty years ago, many popular
European compositions took this shape. &ldquo;The
battle of Navarino,&rdquo; &ldquo;the battle of Prague,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Waterloo,&rdquo; etc., were the out-crops of this
mania: the Chinese certainly have better instruments
than we had, wherewith to represent the
din of combat.</p>
<p>In the accompaniment of songs, the Chinese
seem to stand, as regards their harmony, about
where Europe stood in the middle ages, for they
use as sole and only harmony, when playing on
the <i>kin</i>, a succession of <i>fourths and fifths</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a></p>
<p>The constant use of instruments of percussion,
in slow and monotonous songs, is one of the most
tiresome institutions of the Chinese music; almost
all the tunes are taken at an <i>andante</i> or <i>adagio</i>
pace, and it is but just to say, that the Chinese
chiefly dislike European music because it is often
played quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what purpose&rdquo; they ask, &ldquo;should one dance
and hurry in this manner, and how can such
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
things penetrate to the soul? With us&rdquo; they add
proudly, &ldquo;all is done calmly, and without precipitation.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged, that the Chinese love,
and take pride in music, that is, in their own kind.
In every great state ceremony, in theatres, in
religion, it everywhere plays the leading <i>role</i>.</p>
<p>One of the nine tribunals which have charge of
the general affairs of the empire, is charged with
the care of music, rites, and ceremonies; and the
mandarins of music are considered of much
higher rank than the mandarins of mathematics,
and have their college in the enclosure of the
imperial palace.</p>
<p>The fondness for the art is apparent in all classes,
and music is used on almost every occasion of
festivity, high or low. The streets of the cities
are full of peripatetic musicians, who earn their
living by catering to the general public, somewhat
as the organ grinders do with us.</p>
<p>The feast of lanterns is the greatest of all
popular Chinese festivals; it takes place on the
fifteenth day of the first moon, and corresponds
to a New Year&rsquo;s feast. On this occasion every
part of the immense cities of the empire glows
with the light of innumerable lanterns, while
fire-works and decorations are seen on all sides.
In the streets are seen large <i>Lantern Theatres</i>,
that is to say, edifices made of paper; on the
inside, which is brightly illuminated, is a stage
whereon actors and singers give plays and concerts.
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
Another great festival, where music plays
a leading part, takes place on the fifteenth day of
the eighth moon. On this evening the Chinese
imagine that a <i>hare</i> is seen in the moon, and to
the sound of many instruments, the entire population
turn out to look at it. It is customary for
friends to send each other cakes, on which the
figure of a hare is moulded, in sugar. Concerts
are an important accessory to this festival with
both rich and poor; the former make every effort
to secure the best singers and performers for their
entertainment on this holiday; the latter, not
being able to have the more delicate instruments
content themselves with a clatter of basins, pots
and frying-pans, and make with these a sort of
burlesque concert.</p>
<p>At each full moon there takes place a festival
in which gongs and cannons rather than musical
instruments are heard. Besides these festivals
which are celebrated throughout the empire,
there are also local ones, which are numberless.
The richest class generally keep their private
troupe of musicians, whom they own almost as
slaves. Often also they educate young children
of both sexes, in the musical art with the utmost
care, in order that when grown up they may swell
the ranks of their musical retinue. Among these are
often special artists whom they will not allow to
appear on ordinary occasions, but reserve to
perform before their own family, or intimate
friends to whom they wish to show especial honor;
at such times, the ordinary performers are sent
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Among the strolling musicians, there are many
who make their living by going to private festivals
of the middle classes, such as weddings, birthdays,
and other rejoicings, even when uninvited; these
are similar to our ball room musicians, but also
bear some resemblance to the itinerant performers
of early Eastern nations. In Poland there still
exists a similar class.</p>
<p>For the poorer class, there are also, numerous
blind musicians, who travel from house to house,
sometimes in bands, sometimes alone. We have
already compared these to our own organ-grinders,
but they differ from them in one particular; they
do not rely so much upon making music indiscriminately,
but go, with much tact, to those
places where their services are likely to be
required.</p>
<p>In China the custom of celebrating the birthday
anniversary is universal; these wandering
minstrels recollect the date of the birth of each
individual for miles around, with unerring exactness,
and when a birthday <i>fete</i> occurs in any
family, they may calculate with some degree of
certainty that the music will come without being
sent for.</p>
<p>There are other occasions, where these shrewd
disciples of the muses can turn an honest penny;
if a skillful physician has saved the life of the wife
or child of some rich man no higher compliment
can be given to him (besides his fee) by the
grateful nabob, than to invite him to a great feast,
and to send an escort of eight musicians to convey
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
him thither, besides bringing him numerous
presents.</p>
<p>Music is employed at funerals, but the friends
of the deceased, are not allowed to perform it;
for months after, etiquette forbids their touching
any musical instruments.</p>
<p>The mourning for a parent, or grandparent is
very strict and protracted. In China filial love
and obedience are the virtues most insisted upon.
If the descendants give forth any musical sounds
at all it is only to howl dismally a chant respecting
the virtues of the defunct; there are many of
these compositions, or &ldquo;lamentations&rdquo; in existence,
of which the poetry is by no means despicable.
When the funeral ceremony is taking place,
some trumpets and a drum placed at the door,
announce the arrival of visitors who come with
their condolences to the afflicted family. After
the body is buried with the ancestors, the <i>bonzes</i>,
(Chinese priests) chant the office of the dead, for
nine days, and in the procession itself drums,
trumpets, tam tams, flutes, etc., play a discordant
dirge.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned the wooden fish
suspended at the tent door of military commanders
to summon them to audiences concerning public
and private affairs. Mandarins have, in like
manner, a drum in the outer hall of their palaces,
by means of which they can be summoned to give
audience to any applicant; they are obliged to
give immediate attention to the complaint of any
person beating the drum, but woe to the audacious
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
drummer who does not have some very especial
wrong to complain of; he is immediately soundly
bastinadoed.</p>
<p>At eclipses of the moon, the Chinese use their
musical instruments in a purposely hideous
manner. This is done to frighten away the dragon
which is supposed to be eating up the orb of
night. Instruments of percussion are chiefly
used on this occasion. The same instruments
(i. e. gongs, drums, trumpets and tam-tams) are
used to aid the marching of the army.</p>
<p>The <i>musical language</i> such as we use in directing
the movements of cavalry and artillery, is much
more extended, though differently used in China;
such musical signals are used in commanding
civil as well as military personages. Various trades
have their especial songs also, which they sing at
their work.</p>
<p>But the music of China, although extending
into every department of social and official life,
is totally incapable of any advancement. Musical
martinets are continually exclaiming against the
changes in style of composition, which innovators
are constantly introducing into <i>our</i> art,<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a> but it
is these changes which give the surest signs of
real life and intrinsic merit to modern music.</p>
<p>In China, precisely as formerly in ancient
Egypt, no such changes are possible; the music
for each and every event is as carefully mapped
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
out and adhered to, as is the cut of the garments,
or the exchange of civilities among this precise
people.<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a></p>
<p>If ever change takes place in their musical
system it will assuredly be a gravitation towards
the European, as they have in a certain measure
a comprehension, theoretically at least, of our
system of semi-tones, but could by no means
conceive of, and accurately produce the third and
quarter tones of Indian music. We have already
related the ineffectual movement towards western
style, made in the last century; during the embassy
of 1793, Macartney observed many indications of
inclination for our system, such as the use of the
violin,<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a> the notation of music upon ruled paper,
and interest in the band concerts given at his
rooms each evening. He also found in the
emperor&rsquo;s palace at <i>Yuen min-yuen</i>, an English
musical clock, made by Geo. Clarke, Leadenhall
Street, London, which played many selections
from the &ldquo;Beggar&rsquo;s Opera.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a> It is certainly not
too venturesome to predict, in spite of the jarring
of their music upon us, that they may yet develop
a taste for some of the coarser branches of ours.</p>

<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />THE CHINESE THEATRE AND DANCES.</h2>
<p>Although the Chinese are passionately fond of
plays, yet they do not possess a good fixed theatre
in their chief cities; for those edifices which are
regularly used for this purpose are never of a good
class, and many of them are even considered disreputable.
The cream of the theatrical troupes
are reserved for private entertainments; when a
number of people of the middle class desire a
comedy, they club together and engage a troupe.
The upper classes, as already stated, have always
their private comedy company. They have also
their private halls for dramatic representations.</p>
<p>The Chinese, have like ourselves, Comedies,
Tragedies, Farces, Ballets, etc., and the music
attached to them is always of the style of the
play. There is an excellent description of the
ceremonies and social etiquette used at a private
dramatic entertainment, given by Du Halde.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a>
He says, ... &ldquo;It was then, four or five of the
principal comedians were seen entering the hall,
in rich costumes; they made a profound bow all
together, and struck the earth four times with their
forehead.... They arose and their chief
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
addressing one of the principal guests, presented
to him a book composed of long tablets, on which
were written, in golden letters, the names of fifty
or sixty comedies, which they knew by heart, and
any of which they were ready to perform on the
spot if desired; from this book they begged the
guest to make a choice. The guest excused himself
and handed the volume politely to a second
guest, with a sign of invitation; the second guest
passed it to the third with the same ceremonies,
the third to the fourth, etc. All excused themselves,
and finally the book was returned to the
comedian, who yielded at last, opened the book,
and ran his eye over the list a moment, and then
decided upon a comedy which he thought would
prove agreeable to all the company. Should there
be any inconvenience in producing any particular
play, the comedian-in-chief is expected to announce
it; one of these inconveniences would be, for
example, that one of the chief characters of the
play bore a name similar to that of one of the
guests. After the choice the comedian shows to
the guests the name of the play which he has
chosen, and each one signifies by a nod of the
head, his approval. The representation begins
with some music which is essentially Chinese and
noisy. It is performed with metal basins, drums,
flutes, fifes, and trumpets. The play is often
performed at a banquet, and after the guests have
finished their meal, the comedians take their
places at the table; after a short refreshment the
guests are recalled and the play proceeded with,
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
or a new farce is chosen and performed as dessert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the plays are not destitute of poetry
and plot. It may not be uninteresting to give a
short sketch of the style of incidents woven
into their plays by Chinese authors.</p>
<p>The following is an outline of the plot of a
play performed before the English embassy, Lord
Macartney&rsquo;s, in the latter part of the last century;
it was given in a private theatre, by a private
troupe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An emperor of China and his empress are
living in supreme felicity, when on a sudden his
subjects revolt. A civil war ensues, battles are
fought; and at last, the arch-rebel, who is a general
of cavalry, overcomes his sovereign, kills him
with his own hand, and routs the imperial army.</p>
<p>The captive empress then appears upon the
stage, in all the agonies of despair, naturally
resulting from the loss of her husband, and her
dignity, as well as the apprehension of that of
her honor. Whilst she is tearing her hair, and
rending the skies with her complaints, the
conqueror enters, approaches her with respect,
addresses her in a gentle tone, soothes her sorrows
with his compassion, talks of love and adoration,
and like Richard the Third with Lady Anne, in
Shakespeare, prevails, in less than half an hour,
on the Chinese princess to dry up her tears, to
forget her deceased consort, and to yield to a
consoling wooer. The piece concludes with a
wedding and a grand procession.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Engel, who quotes the above plot, well says<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a>
&ldquo;how interesting would it be to the student of
national music, to possess an exact notation of the
music belonging to this scene &lsquo;(the empress
complaints)&rsquo; and to ascertain in what manner the
intense emotions and vehement passions represented
are expressed in the Chinese musical compositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above plot is curious in its Shakespearian
resemblance, and seems to be a drama of the
superior order, for Lord Macartney was shown the
highest and best side of Chinese life and art; the
comedies of the people are less refined and of
broader touches. We give as companion piece to
the above, a comedy plot which is a favorite one
with Chinese authors as well as the public.</p>
<p>The emperor Vouti, having lost one of his
wives, whom he tenderly loved, had recourse to a
celebrated magician, who assured him that his
spouse was not dead as supposed, for she had
bought of him the elixir of immortality; she
still existed, but lived chiefly in the moon from
whence the magician promised he could cause her
to descend as often as desired. The emperor
caused to be erected, under the superintendence
of the magician, a very high tower, to facilitate
her descent; he also often assisted at the incantations
of the wizard, but as the fair immortal did
not respond, the imposter, fearing the anger of
his royal master, invented a new stratagem to
avert this unpleasant conclusion. He wrote upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
a piece of silk a counterfeit letter from the dear
defunct giving various pretended reasons as to
why she could not return personally to the royal
lover; this letter is given by the sorcerer to a
cow, who is then led by him to the emperor
to whom he confesses that some involuntary
crime has, for the present, interrupted his intercourse
and influence with the immortal beings,
but that in the stomach of the cow he has
perceived something; Vouti commands that the
animal be opened on the spot, and the silken
message is discovered; the magician is already
enjoying his triumph when it is perceived that the
characters of the communication are in his own
handwriting. He is at once condemned to death,
and the emperor thenceforth renounces magicians,
immortal elixirs, etc., etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a></p>
<p>It is well known that the Chinese often give, on
the stage, a representation of the life of the hero
of the play from early infancy (sometimes even
<i>from birth</i>) to death, and these representations
last weeks in their performance; every action
being done deliberately; for example, if a performer
smokes a pipe, he does not give a whiff
or two and then go on with the action, but calmly
and placidly smokes it out to the last puff.</p>
<p>Fairy spectacles, the Chinese also possess, in
which Genii appear and disappear, as well as
birds and beasts endowed with the power of
speech. Their farces are of a much broader
character, and often in these, the clownish, awkward
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
character is a European or an American;
they heartily enjoy all his mishaps, even his manner
of lifting his hat and bowing, being held up to
ridicule; it is very much the same kind of
pleasure as we &ldquo;western barbarians&rdquo; enjoy in
seeing such farces as &ldquo;<i>Ici on parle Francais</i>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;The Perplexed Dutchman,&rdquo; where the habits of a
Frenchman, and German, are the mirth-provoking
element; or of a piece with the character of Sir
Hugh Evans and Dr. Caius, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Merry Wives of Windsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is another point of resemblance in
Shakespeare, to the Chinese drama: his following
of the life of Henry <span class="smaller">VI.</span> so closely and extensively
(through three parts) suggests the more extensive
life-history-dramas of the celestial empire. But
the Chinese also give the &ldquo;outside barbarians&rdquo; a
thrust, <i>au serieux</i>; for in their plays the devil often
appears, dressed as a European.</p>
<p>In the music of their dramas, the Chinese are
decidedly Wagnerian, for not only do they use a
great many loud instruments (chiefly of percussion)
but they illustrate with them the action of the
drama; when an actor enters into a combat at
arms, the orchestra pound away at their instruments
with redoubled vigor. The characters often
sing long <i>arias</i> to the accompaniment of these
voice-drowning instruments.<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a> There is much
spoken action as well as song in these dramas,
which therefore approach more nearly to our
<i>vaudevilles</i> than any thing else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Choruses are few in Chinese pieces, but sometimes
the air is sung by many voices, in order to
emphasize it, and make it more plainly perceptible
above the racket of the orchestra.</p>
<p>The Chinese have also many tragedies and
comedies wherein no music whatever is employed.
The actors in these, assuming the ordinary conversational
tone.</p>
<p>Conjugal infelicity and infidelity, form a staple
plot with these, and the same inappropriate and
ludicrous entering into detail is apparent in them.<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a></p>
<p>Movable scenes are not used, and the most
infantile devices are used when a rapid change is
necessary; a general having to depart on a distant
expedition, mounts a hobby horse, or even a cane,
and using a small whip with one hand, imitates
riding, (three or four times around the theatre
being sufficient) and then, announcing that he has
arrived at his destination, goes on with his speeches
without any embarrassment. This is but one
example of the many where the dramatists draw
heavily upon the imagination of their audiences.</p>
<p>The actor on entering (in the play) begins by
announcing his name and telling the audience why
and wherefore he has come; this is done to
simplify the following of the action, as in some
dramas there are hosts of characters and one
player often assumes many <i>roles</i>.</p>
<p>Such puerility is caused partly by the small size
of the stages, which would not admit a host of
performers, and partly by the fact that many of
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
the characters in a Chinese play are comparatively
unimportant, appearing once, and then vanishing
forever; in fact at the end of some of the Chinese
dramas, one is considerably mystified as to the fate
of many of the characters, as the author, unlike
the European and American dramatists, who make
everybody (except the villain) happy in the last
act, only deems it necessary to follow out closely
the career of his hero and heroine, and they
being once dead, the other characters are allowed
to wind up in a very sudden and, to us, very
unsatisfactory manner. The musical part of
these dramas is often quite long, and whenever
the actor desires to express much feeling, he falls
into music. Sometimes it is introduced in a most
unnatural manner; in one tragedy, a wife having
murdered her husband is sentenced to be <i>flayed
alive</i>; after the execution of the sentence, she
returns to the stage wholly bereft of her skin,
(this is depicted with true Chinese realistic effect,
the body of the performer being painted in exact
imitation of nature in such a hideous plight) and
she then and there sings a song to excite the pity
of the infernal spirits. The song is full of
screeches and howls, and lasts half an hour.<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a>
Let us not be too hasty in smiling at such absurd
stage effects; there is an opera still performed on
our own stage, where an innocent Jewess is boiled
in oil, as <i>finale</i>, and as to the inappropriateness of
a long song, under such circumstances, there is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
long chorus in a French opera of the last century,
where the mayor of the village having fallen into
the water, the anxious choristers sing for many
minutes, that &ldquo;he will he drowned unless he is
speedily helped out;&rdquo; decidedly we must not
smile too broadly at the Chinese, as yet.</p>
<p>Sir John Barrow<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a> speaks of the theatre, which
he visited, as a mere &ldquo;Shed of Bamboo.&rdquo; He
says: &ldquo;In the farther division of the building, a
party of comedians were engaged in the midst of an
historical drama, when we entered; but on our
being seated they broke off, and coming forward,
made before us an obeisance of nine genuflexions
and prostrations, after which they returned to their
labors, keeping up an incessant noise and bustle
during our stay. The heat of the day, the thermometer
standing at eighty-one degrees, in the open
air, and at least ten degrees higher in the building,
the crowds that thronged to see the strangers [this
was in 1792, when Europeans were great rarities
in China] the horrible crash of the gongs, kettle
drums, trumpets, and squalling flutes, were so
stunning and oppressive that nothing but the
novelty of the scene could possibly have detained
us a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most entertaining, as well as the least noisy
part of the theatrical exhibition, was a sort of
interlude, performed by three young women, for
the amusement it would seem of the principal
actress, who sat as a spectator, in the dress and
character of some ancient queen, whilst an old
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
eunuch, very whimsically dressed, played his antic
tricks like a scaramouch, or buffoon in a Harlequin
entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dialogue in this part, differed entirely from
the querulous and nearly monotonous recitation
of the Chinese, being light and comic, and
occasionally interrupted by cheerful airs, which
generally concluded with a chorus. These airs
rude and unpolished as they were, appeared to be
regular compositions, and were sung in exactly
measured time. One in particular attracted our
attention, whose slow, melancholy movement
breathed the kind of plaintiveness so peculiar to
the native airs of the Scotch, to which indeed it
bore a close resemblance.&rdquo; [We have before
spoken of this resemblance, which proceeds from
both scales, Chinese and Scotch, being pentatonic,
or five toned.] &ldquo;The voices of the women are shrill
and warbling, but some of their cadences were not
without melody. The instruments at each pause
gave a few short flourishes, till the music gradually
increased in loudness by the swelling and deafening
gong. Knowing nothing of the language we
were of course as ignorant of the subject as the
majority of an English audience is at an Italian
opera.&rdquo; Thus speaks Barrow of his first impressions
of a Chinese theatre, but he probably fell into
two errors; the <i>women</i>, whom he mentions were
in all likelihood, eunuchs; and the theatre itself,
being public, was of inferior style to those private
establishments which are the pride of the rich
mandarin class.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>It is singular, however, that the noise of the
gong, tamtam, trumpet, etc., are inseparable from
all Chinese dramatic performances: although the
noise is deafening, and the voices of the actors are
sometimes drowned in spite of their shouting
themselves hoarse, yet this pandemonium only
gives tranquil delight to the Chinese spectator
whether he be of high or low class. It is so
extraordinary a fact that physiologists and
anatomists have endeavored to prove that the
cause is due to a peculiar formation of the
Chinese ear.<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a></p>
<p>Certain it is that the Chinese are so passionately
fond of the drama, that they will sometimes pass
many hours in succession in this noisy entertainment.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous number of comedians in
China; most of them are purchased in early infancy
by the chiefs of troupes, and by them trained in
music, singing, declamation, pantomime, and
dance. It is a species of slavery, not very unlike
that of old Rome, but is not always life-long.</p>
<p>Some comedians, especially the chiefs, acquire
large fortunes in the exercise of their calling, but
the caste is so looked down upon, by the general
public, and the facility of confiscating their fortune
is so great, that they seldom attempt to leave
the profession, or make any display of their
wealth, lest it should be seized under any pretext
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
by some mandarin, in which case (in spite of the
theoretical justice of China) it would probably be
beyond recovery.<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a></p>
<p>We may mention here, a peculiar mode of paying
actors, in Cochin China.</p>
<p>The occasion described is an entertainment, the
expenses of which were borne by the Quong, or
provincial governor. An Englishman who was
present, thus speaks of the affair,&mdash;&ldquo;The Quong
was there squatted on a raised platform in front of
the actors, with a small drum before him, supported
in a diagonal position, on which he would strike a
tap every time any part of the performance
pleased him; which was also a signal for his purse
bearer to show a small string of about twenty
<i>cash</i> to the actors. To my taste this spoiled the
effect of the piece; for every time the <i>cash</i> fell
among them, there would be a silence, and the
next moment a scramble for the money; and it
fell so frequently as almost to keep time with the
discordant music of the orchestra.</p>
<p>The actors were engaged by the day, and in this
manner received their payment, the amount of
which depended upon the approbation of the
<i>Quong</i>, and the number of times he encored them
by tapping his drum. I could see that many of
them paid far more attention to the drum than
they did to their performance; though I suppose
the amount thrown to them is equally divided.
Sometimes the string on which the <i>cash</i> was tied,
unluckily broke, and the money flew in all directions;
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
by which some of the by-standers profited,
not being honorable enough to hand it up to the
poor actors.<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
<p>This was a public performance and took place in
a large shed, before a numerous audience. Often
the theatrical performances are allowed to take
place in the Joss-houses or houses of worship, the
<i>bonzes</i> or priests being wise enough not to offer
any obstacles to a mode of amusement so thoroughly
loved and appreciated by all the Chinese.</p>
<p>It is somewhat singular, and yet in keeping
with the custom of the most ancient nations, that
the Chinese should at the same time enjoy the
drama so keenly, and despise the performers of
it. The comedians are kept as thoroughly within
their caste as musicians were in Egypt, four
thousand years ago. Parents in China have almost
unlimited power over their children (filial love
and obedience is the highest of Chinese virtues,)
they may sell them as slaves, or in some instances
kill them, but they are not allowed to sell them to
the troupes of strolling comedians, or to magicians.
Any person so selling them is punished with one
hundred blows of the bamboo, and any go-between
or middle-man, in such transactions, receives a
similar dose; any person of free parentage,
marrying an actor or actress, is punished in the
same manner, in spite of the precedent of several
emperors. The crime of intimacy with actresses
is punishable with sixty blows, but this is easily
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
eluded, and the law seems to be obsolete. This
punishment is not attended with much infamy;
the bastinado is in fact the lightest of Chinese
punishments. When the number of blows does
not exceed twenty, there is no disgrace whatever
attached to the infliction: it is then considered only
a paternal chastisement; the emperor himself often
orders this correction to be administered to high
officials for slight faults, and afterwards treats
them as if nothing had happened. After such
paternal punishment is inflicted, the victim goes
on his knees to the judge, bows his head three
times to the earth, and <i>thanks him</i> for the care he
has given to the education of his subject.<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
<p>It is significant that the &ldquo;State Gazette&rdquo; of
Pekin, which will often enter into details concerning
the death of a private soldier, and give
eulogies to the military valor of the most humble,
does not even mention the decease of the most
brilliant and well-known comedian, no matter how
much applause may have been accorded to him
while living.</p>
<p>In such a country as China, it is easily imagined
that there exists a large troupe of &ldquo;comedians to
the emperor.&rdquo; These although not more superbly
costumed than those of some rich mandarins, are
clothed in a peculiar manner. Of course it would
not be allowable to turn their backs upon the
emperor, and yet often the action of the play,
might demand that they turn around. This
dilemma is overcome by allowing them to wear
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
two masks, one on the face, the other at the back
of their head, and thus, Janus-like, they can
always face the emperor. Their clothing is in
consequence different from that of ordinary actors,
having two fronts and no back.<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a></p>
<p>The <i>corps</i> of singers, declaimers and musicians
of all kinds belonging to the Imperial court, is of
course very large.</p>
<p>The dances of China, are as with all Eastern or
ancient nations, purely pantomimical, there are
few pirouettes and skips as in our <i>ballet</i>. The
names and subjects of some of the earlier dancers,
will show this conclusively; &ldquo;The labors of
Agriculture,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joys of the Harvest,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
fatigues of War,&rdquo; &ldquo;The pleasures of Peace,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The skill of Hunting,&rdquo; etc. These all show a
primitive style of the art, and are not far removed
from the dances we shall find in vogue among the
most crude children of nature, such as the
Australians, the Bushmen, or the Tasmanians.
The Chinese possess (as did the Egyptians) a
number of gymnastic performances similar to our
clog, ballet, and comic dances, but these come a
long way after the dance proper, in the estimation
of the people; the word <i>ou</i> which signifies dance,
does not apply to them. We cannot be surprised
if from earliest times the regulation of the dance
has been a matter of State legislation.</p>
<p>The ancient emperor was allowed eight dances,
with eight performers to each, his full troupe
containing sixty-four members. Kings of Provinces
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
had six dances of six performers, thirty-six in
all; and thus through all the upper ranks, literary
doctors being allowed only two dances of two
performers each. Only certain instruments were
allowed as accompaniment, and the direction of
the whole was always to be in charge of various
musical doctors. There also existed dances which
were called &ldquo;little dances,&rdquo; as they were taught to
children at a tender age; the names of some of
these are interesting; &ldquo;the Dance of the Flag,&rdquo;
danced in honor of the spirits of earth and the
harvests, so called because the dancers waved
small banners; &ldquo;The Dance of the Plumes,&rdquo; in
honor of the spirits of the four quarters of the
world, in which the young dancers carried a plume
of white feathers, attached to a short stick; &ldquo;The
Dance of the Foang-hoang,&rdquo; which was danced to
induce the assistance of the mysterious bird
(already described) in times of drought, and in
which the dancers held plumes of feathers of five
colors; &ldquo;the Dance of the Ox Tail,&rdquo; in which
each dancer swings an ox tail; &ldquo;The Dance of
Javelins,&rdquo; where this weapon was brandished in
honor of river and mountain spirits; and finally,
&ldquo;the Dance of Man,&rdquo; in which the hands were
quite free, no accessories being used.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Javelin Dance,&rdquo; was not altogether
pleasing to the great philosopher Confucius. He
condemns it as being too war-like, and the gestures
accompanying it, as too savage; as a whole he
thought it liable to inspire cruel sentiments. He
preferred the &ldquo;Dance of the Plumes,&rdquo; as containing
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
all the chief elements of the &ldquo;Javelin Dance&rdquo;
without tendency to cruelty. In the palace, the
sons of the emperor only, were permitted to
the &ldquo;Dance of the Plumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the epoch, when these dances were at their
zenith, the emperors had a peculiar way of showing
by them their approbation, or condemnation
of their viceroys. When the viceroy was presented
at court, if his administration seemed good
to the emperor, he was welcomed by numerous
and lengthy dances; if, on the contrary his
government seemed worthy of censure, the dances
were both short and few.</p>
<p>The following were the customs observed in
presenting them:&mdash;Long before the dance began,
a drum was sounded &ldquo;to dispel from the minds of
the spectators any thoughts unsuited to the
occasion.&rdquo; On the arrival of the performers,
they took three steps forward and put themselves
in an attitude, calculated to impress the beholders;
a sort of <i>tableau vivant</i>. The entrance was always
accompanied with a slow movement of the music,
which gradually augmented both in speed and
volume, until the <i>finale</i>, when the climax having
been reached, the music had attained a presto
movement, and the dancers retired with precipitation
in order that the interest might not have
time to flag.</p>
<p>Sometimes the dancers carried a small shield
with bell attached.</p>
<p>The Chinese sages deeply regret the loss of
these ancient dances; (for like all excellent customs
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
the modern writers claim that they were at their
best in &ldquo;the good old times,&rdquo;) it seems that the
ancient Chinese, endeavored in the dance, to
reproduce an easily-comprehended allegory of the
natural actions of men; the movements, gestures,
attitudes, and evolutions, all to be natural and
easily understood by the spectators. Since the
days of Confucius, this simple style of dancing
has fallen greatly to decay.</p>
<p>In those days many of the emperors of China
studied and understood the art of dancing. History
shows many such &ldquo;Davids&rdquo; (although not
so well known as Israel&rsquo;s royal dancer) in the
dynasties of the empire. Autumn was the favorite
season for the study of dancing, as the &ldquo;feast of
ancestors&rdquo; takes place in the Spring, and the
pupils were ready to exhibit their proficiency at
that great event. The ancient practice of imperial
dancing, was continued even as recently as 1719,
when one of the sons of Kang-hi, of the age of
twenty, performed before the emperor and his
court. There are also mandarins whose duty it is
to dance before the emperor; the pantomime of
these is especially graceful and dignified. They
advance slowly two by two, their limbs and bodies
moving gently to the time of a tranquil music;
they turn around without quitting their relative
positions, and after a series of gestures made in
perfect unison, and some symmetrical evolutions,
they make the salute of honor, and retire. This
dance seems to be only a formal expression of
homage to the emperor. The dress of these
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
officials is uniform, and elegant, fine silk capes,
caps, etc., the only difference of costume being
the buttons, with which the top of the caps are
ornamented; the different color of these being
indicative of greater or lesser rank. This <i>corps</i>
of dancers is recruited from the wealthiest and
greatest families of the empire.</p>
<p>In the dances, every detail is strictly systemized
and observed; the very positions are calculated
according to the points of the compass; thus one
dancer is always placed at the north-west, another
at the north-east, the entrance is to be made from
a fixed cardinal point, the exit at another; all is
rule and precision.</p>
<p>The number of dancers is not at present limited
to that given above (sixty-four for the emperor,
thirty-six for viceroys, etc.) as the ancient standard.
At times of great festivity, the dancers
of the Imperial court are reckoned by hundreds.
Such <i>grandes ballets</i>, are almost always symmetrical
and in concerted movements; but there are
also <i>solo</i> dances; in these <i>pas seuls</i> the dancer
often accompanies himself with both song and
instrument. This proves how slow and majestic
the motions must be.</p>
<p>In dances, females very often appear, but in
private only. Mandarins frequently own female
dancers and singers, whose performances are
reserved for their own families. It is but rarely,
and as a mark of especial honor, that they allow
some intimate friend to view the dancing of these
slaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Spectacular pantomimes, such as delight the theatre-goers
at Christmas time in Europe and America,
find also a congenial atmosphere in China; a most
beautiful one was performed in the presence of the
emperor, and Lord Macartney, in 1793. In this
representation the object seemed to be, to illustrate
upon the stage, the wonders and fertility of the
world, or an allegory of the intermarriage of earth
and ocean. The earth gave forth in this pantomime,
a large number of its animals, and products;
elephants, tigers, dragons, ostriches and eagles,
as well as oaks, pines, bamboos, and other specimens
of vegetation appeared upon the stage;
while upon a lower stage, the ocean sent forth
whales, dolphins, porpoises, and also vessels, rocks,
weeds, sponges, and coral. Each of these creations
was true to life, and in many of them were
concealed actors who represented the motions and
habits of the animals in a manner quite natural.
After these products of earth and sea had performed
several evolutions separately, each division
moving in a separate circle, all united and came
to the front of the stage, where a farther series of
movements was enacted; suddenly the entire mass
of actors divided, moving swiftly to the right and
left in order to give place to the whale, who
seemed a sort of commander in chief. This
immense fish then advanced to the front of the
stage, opposite the box in which the emperor was
seated; on arriving here, he lifted his head and
spurted an enormous mass of water, amounting to
many barrels full, into the pit of the theatre;
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
where (holes having been bored to receive it) it
swiftly disappeared.<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a></p>
<p>This performance seemed to give the greatest
delight to the Chinese part of the audience. The
music attached to this spectacle, was as usual of
the most deafening character.</p>
<p>Of the lower order of dances, such as tumbling,
harlequinades, etc., the Chinese have a vast variety;
even puppet shows (<i>marionettes</i>) are greatly used
by them, and plays with simple plots, very skilfully
given by their means. This is the story represented
at one of them;&mdash;An unfortunate princess is
kept prisoner in a castle surrounded by dragons:
to her comes a bold warrior, who after many
combats with dragons, wild beasts and other
horrible creations, succeeds in killing, vanquishing
and dispersing them. He is recompensed by
receiving the hand of the grateful princess, and
the whole concludes with processions, tournaments
and other festivities.<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a></p>
<p>As to the musical part of all these lesser performances,
it is nearly always present, and ever of
the peculiar style which has filled every traveller
(so far as we know <i>without exception</i>), with utter
distaste. The juggling performances, of which
there are many, both public and private, are
accompanied throughout with the above described
orchestra. Feats of skill, performed by troupes of
children are especially admired by the Chinese, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
much sought for. The children begin their training
in these arts, very young.</p>
<p>Boat races have also their music, which is
evidently intended to inspirit the oarsmen. The
following is a description of such an event, (so
far as it relates to music).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On each side of the little mast that supports
the national flag, are two men, who leave off
striking the tum-tum, and executing rolls upon
the drum, whilst the mariners leaning over their
oars, row on vigorously, and make the dragon
junk, skim rapidly over the water.</p>
<p>Whilst these elegant boats are contending with
each other, the people throng the quays, the shore
and the roofs.... They animate the rowers
with their cries and plaudits; they let off fireworks;
they perform at various points, deafening music,
in which the sonorous noise of the tum-tum, and
the sharp sound of a sort of a clarinet, giving
perpetually the same note, predominate over all
the rest. The Chinese relish this infernal harmony.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a></p>
<p>We have dwelt with some detail upon the music
of the Chinese, for we consider these people,
musically as well as ethnologically and philologically
a series of contradictions, and especially
differing from all our conceived notions of right
and propriety: a nation where music is heartily
loved, and taught to youth,<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a> and yet where
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
musical progress is almost unknown; where goodness
and love are taught in the most beautiful
writings, and where greater cruelties are practised
than anywhere else on earth. They differ from us
on almost every point. We mourn in black, they
in white; we respect crowns as badges of honor,
they the boots; we build solid walls, they make
them hollow; we pull a boat, they push it; we
place the orchestra in front of the stage; they
behind it; with us children fly kites, with them,
men; we scratch the head when puzzled, they, the
antipodes of it, etc, etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a></p>
<p>A nation so strange cannot be judged flippantly
or speedily; only a short time since we held the
Japanese in the rank of the semi-civilized; now
they are making giant strides on the highway of
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
progress. Who dare say that the Chinese may
not yet experience a similar awakening? At
present their heaviest drawbacks, in music, as
well as in all civilization, seem to be, a senseless
clinging to ancient usages; an education of the
head, and not of the heart; an etiquette which
becomes both ludicrous and burdensome in its
requirements;<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a> a totally false position of woman;
and a theoretically competitive, but practically
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
corrupt public service. There have recently been
unmistakeable signs of progress, and, once begun,
it is more than probable that the reform will be
thorough and swift as it has thus far been with
their neighbors. In such case, China will be of
far higher interest to the world than she has been
to us in our describing her as&mdash;a curiosity shop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br />MUSIC OF JAPAN.</h2>
<p>It is a singular fact, that while the Japanese
have in all ages given a great deal of attention to
poetry the kindred art of music has been suffered
to remain almost neglected. Their musical system
has never been carefully formed or elucidated,
and although they may vie with the Chinese in
the beauty of their poetical effusions, in the field
of music their research is nothing, when compared
with the immense patience and study which the
latter people have given to the subject.</p>
<p>Although there are few treatises on the art,
yet the practice of music is now deemed an essential
part of the education of a Japanese young
lady, for contrary to Chinese custom, we find that
in Japan, the female sex are proficient in the art.</p>
<p>Although at first glance there seems to be much
affinity between Japanese and Chinese music,
(so much so, that it seems natural to suppose that
the former was an outgrowth of the latter) yet,
upon closer analysis, these resemblances are found
to be few, and the contradictions many and irreconcilable.</p>
<p>The Japanese songs do not appear to have been
founded on the Chinese pentatonic scale, but rather
upon the <i>chromatic</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>It is very possible, that the music of Japan had
its rise long ago, within the limits of the island.
Unfortunately, in this branch of history, we can
as yet, come to no definite conclusion; the absence
of all knowledge of the system (if there be one
worthy of the name) on which their melodies are
formed, and the very slight knowledge of the
ancient history of the people, confine us altogether
to conjecture and inference. That China exerted
some influence upon the musical style of Japan,
is undeniable. In the year (<span class="smaller">A. D.</span>) 57, an embassy
was sent from the island, to the Emperor of
China, with presents. The return of this expedition,
brought to the (at that time) totally rude and
uncultivated people, the fruits of the older Chinese
civilization, and it was probably at that epoch,
that the Chinese instruments, which still exist in
Japan, were introduced.</p>
<p>The instruments of Japan, though resembling,
are much cruder than their Chinese, prototypes.
The <i>che</i>, of China, is found under the name of
<i>koto</i>. It is larger than the <i>che</i>, but has fewer
strings; the latter are of silk, lightly lacquered.
The <i>sam-sin</i> is a guitar, with a very long neck,
and has three strings. These instruments are
among the indispensable articles of the wedding
outfit of every bride.<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a></p>
<p>Of wind instruments they have many styles of
flutes and a trumpet, made of a conch shell.<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a>
The <i>cheng</i> (small mouth organ) is also possessed
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
by them. It is called in Corean dialect <i>saing-hwang</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a>
Gongs, tamtams, and noisy instruments
of percussion, the Japanese possess in profusion;
they have also a curious instrument, quite like the
Egyptian sistrum,<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a> formed of two sonorous metallic
rings upon a light frame work, which give
forth a tinkling and jingling upon being shaken,
or struck with a small stick.<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a> The <i>ko-kiou</i>
is a kind of violoncello played with a bow; the
birva is a similar instrument, which is picked
with a <i>plectrum</i>. The same plectrum is used in
performing upon the <i>sam-sin</i>. The clarionet is
used very frequently; it is made of bamboo, like
the flute. There is also an eight-holed flageolet.
Among the instruments of percussion, are wooden
rattles; stone drums like bowls, which stand on
low frames; a musical drum made of leather; the
<i>tam-tam</i>, or portable tambourine; gongs of all
shapes, such as shields, fishes, tortoises, etc.,
producing all tones grave and piercing; bells,
and kettle drums.</p>
<p>The tambourines which accompany the character
dances, are sometimes played two at a time;
one being held under the arm, the other in the
left hand.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a> There is a picture extant, representing
a Japanese concert, in which there is one
melodious instrument (a flute) against <i>six</i> instruments
of percussion, such as bells, cymbals and
drums.<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>The Japanese ladies not only play the various
instruments, but study singing, assiduously. The
language is well adapted to vocal efforts, being
one of the most melodious and soft of the East;
it approaches the Italian in its smoothness; it is
monosyllabic,<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a> but not varying with the pitch of
the voice, as the Chinese does. (The written
characters have been derived from the Chinese.)
The very alphabet, or the nearest Japanese
approach to it, is converted into a short song,
which is characteristic of the materialistic views
of the people.</p>
<p>The poetic setting of the &ldquo;Irova&rdquo; (as this
is called) runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Color and light pass away</p>
<p class="t0">In our world nothing is permanent</p>
<p class="t0">The present day has disappeared</p>
<p class="t0">In the profound abyss of nothingness.</p>
<p class="t0">It was but the pale image of a dream;</p>
<p class="t0">It causes in our bosoms no regret.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Nothing can give a stronger picture of the
philosophy of Buddhism and its influence upon the
Japanese mind.</p>
<p>Buddhism was so well suited to the temper of
the people, that upon its introduction into the
country (<span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 552) it almost absorbed the ancient
style of worship (Sintuism), and has, at the present
time, so altered that superstition, that the prevailing
aspiration of one branch, even of that creed, is an
escape from trouble into nothingness. The mode
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
of worship is exceedingly simple, and in the
main, joyous; there is no thought of supplication
to their deities; for as they regard these as being
in a state of bliss, they deem that the sight of any
person in distress, must be painful to them, and
therefore, when in trouble, they avoid going to
religious exercises. In fact on the days of religious
festivals, they behave in a manner which we
should call decidedly immoral, but they do it with
the best of motives, for they argue that nothing
can please the gods more than to see mortals
enjoying themselves heartily; and on this plea,
both Buddhists and Sintuists indulge in all kinds
of excesses on holidays.</p>
<p>Music does not play a very important part in
the religious ceremonies of Japan. The Sintuists,
who worship the Kami, or demi-gods, employ
choirs on some occasions, and bear in all their
ceremonies, some resemblance to the Catholic
rites; this resemblance is yet more striking in the
Buddhist religion; so much so, that a pious divine<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a>
on beholding their customs, came to the conclusion
that the whole was a parody by Satan, upon the
Catholic church.</p>
<p>The annual <i>fetes</i> instituted in honor of the
chief Kami, consist almost wholly in ceremonies
of purification. On the day before the chief
solemnity, the priests march in procession, with
tapers, to the temple where the arms and other
objects which belonged to the demi-god, are kept
in a reliquary called <i>mikosi</i>. According to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
priests, the <i>mikosi</i> is the earthly dwelling place of
the <i>Kami</i>; a sort of terrestrial throne, for
occasional inhabitance; and each year it must
undergo a thorough purification, in order to be
acceptable to the hero. The reliquary is emptied
and brought to the river; a certain number of
priests carefully wash it, while others kindle a
series of huge fires, to keep away the evil <i>genii</i>.
The <i>kagoura</i>, or sacred choir, play soft and pleasant
music, in order to appease the Kami, who is
temporarily deprived of his earthly dwelling; they
make as much haste as possible to restore it to him,
which is done by placing the relics again in the
reliquary.</p>
<p>The temple itself undergoes a purification lasting
several days, at the same time. Sometimes the
Buddhists send out collectors for their temples,
who sing and play, quite musically, in front of the
doors of persons from whom they expect to obtain
a gratuity; they continue at each door until the
heart of the proprietor is softened, or his patience
gone, when the door is opened and the singers
rewarded civilly.<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a></p>
<p>In order that the similarity of the Buddhist and
Christian rites may be remarked, we give the
description of the interior of a temple during
worship, as seen by a European traveller.<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred kneeling devotees were present; a
large shrine, with a gilt image in its recess; two
large globular lamps, and two burning candles,
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
immensely long and thick; as also numerous gold
and porcelain vases, holding lighted tapers, and
surrounded by a forest of artificial flowers, were
the objects that most riveted his attention. On
both sides of this magnificent and richly gilded
shrine were two smaller ones, each illuminated
with lighted candles and perfumed tapers, burning
with colored flame; the effect of which was very
beautiful. In front of the principal altar, within
an enclosure, knelt six shaven-headed priests (the
latter, and physicians shave the whole of the hair
off their heads), robed in crimson silk, and white
crape; the centre and chief of whom engaged
himself in striking a small saucer-shaped bell,
while four more of the number performed a similar
duty with padded drumsticks on hollow vessels
of lacquered wood, which awoke a dull, monotonous
sound. They kept good time, playing in
unison, and toning their prayers to their music in
chanting. At the conclusion of this singing and
drumming they bent their foreheads to the floor,
after which they arose and repaired to the smaller
shrines, where a ceremony made up of gesticulation
and a solemn reading of prayers, took place.
In the meantime, the audience knelt, with their
eyes directed to the ground, and gave some time
to silent prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Music bore a part also in the funeral ceremonies
of some sects in Japan. The priest sang a eulogy
of the dead, just before the funeral pile was set on
fire.<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>The order of &ldquo;mountain priests&rdquo; use a few
instruments of sound (rather than music) in their
wanderings. They have a staff with a copper
head, to which are fastened four rings, also of
copper, which they shake on uttering certain
words in their prayers. They also carry a shell
called <i>forano-kai</i>, to which a tube is attached, and
which they use as a trumpet. They blow a blast
upon this instrument (which in tone resembles
the horn of a cowherd) whenever they see any
travellers approaching, as a summons to them to
give some charity to the order.<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a></p>
<p>There also exist several orders of a semi-ecclesiastical
character; among which may be mentioned
the society of blind men. One branch of this
society gives the following legend as to its origin.
Kakekigo, a general much renowned for his valor
and supernatural strength, fought under a prince,
named Feki, against the famous hero, Joritomo.
In a great battle Feki was killed, and Kakekigo
taken prisoner. Joritomo, far from desiring to put
him to death, sought by every means to attach him
to his own army. One day, when he was pressing
him very close to enter into his service, upon
whatever terms he pleased, the captive general
returned him the following resolute answer:&mdash;&ldquo;I
was once the faithful servant of a kind master.
Now that he is dead no other shall boast of
possessing my faith and friendship. I owe even
my life to your clemency; and yet such is my
misfortune, that I cannot set my eyes on you, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
with a design, in revenge of him and me, to cut
off your head. Therefore, these designing instruments
of mischief, I will offer to you, as the only
acknowledgement of your generous behavior
towards me which my unhappy condition will allow
me to give you.&rdquo; Saying this, he plucked out his
eyes, and presented them, on a salver, to Joritomo;
who, astonished at so much magnanimity and
resolution, instantly set him at liberty.</p>
<p>Kakekigo then retired into the province of Fiuga,
where he learned to play upon the birva (a musical
instrument mentioned above), and founded
the society of the Feki-blind, of which he himself
was the first head. Many of the members of this
society apply themselves to music, in which
capacity they are employed at the courts of Princes
and great men, as also upon public solemnities,
festivals, processions, weddings, and the like. The
society does not solicit charity, but its members
all strive to be self-supporting, as well as of
mutual assistance to each other. Whoever is once
admitted as a member, must remain so for life.<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a></p>
<p>The Birva, mentioned above, is a great favorite
with the masses, especially when played by the
Feki musicians, who still make it their chief
instrument. It has been known in Japan for
twelve hundred years;<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a> and one of the most beautiful
lakes in Japan, near Kiota is named Birva
Lake, from its shores resembling the outline of
that instrument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The religious chanting of some of the larger
sects, is quite impressive. Mr. Sile, Professor of
History and Philosophy at the Imperial University
of Yeddo, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Some of the chants are very
impressive; especially those of the Buddhists;
they have a kind of sepulchral solemnity about
them, and when performed responsively by large
companies of Bonzes, on either side of a gloomy
temple, in front of a shadowy half-illumined
shrine, they sound like the mournful wailings of
prisoners, not of hope, but of despair.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a></p>
<p>The peculiarity of the performance lies in this:
every man chants, not on a given key, but on
that which best suits his natural voice. The time
is well kept, but the key notes are as various as
each voice that sings; as each one is allowed to
choose his own pitch. The effect is good; it giving
that blurred and massive sound, which is observed
when a large congregation repeats the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer&rdquo; together; but the inflections and intervals
are more marked and effective. Instrumental
music is also sometimes present. The
bonzes clad in heavy, sacerdotal vestments,
officiate to an accompaniment of gongs and tambourines.</p>
<p>The solemn entry of the high priest into the
choir, makes an immediate diversion in the
monotony of the service. This grand dignitary
is clad as richly as the bishops and arch-bishops of
the west; red cloak, green silk stole, and white
embroidered robes. He is followed by a young
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
acolyte, dressed chiefly in white, who accompanies
his master, step by step, to offer to him, at an
understood signal, a cup of tea from a portable
vessel which he carries with both hands.<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a></p>
<p>Some of the Buddhist bonze-houses are celebrated
for their luxury, the number of their
priests, their magnificent attire, and the theatrical
grandeur of their religious ceremonies. There
are also endless numbers of retainers, heralds,
grooms and porters, attached to the monasteries.
The bonzes often give theatrical spectacles, in
which dancers and comedians appear. A very
curious piece is given on the fifteenth day of the
sixth month. It is a sword dance, or military
pageant, performed entirely by the priests.
Buddhism in Japan has been a most flexible and
conciliatory religion. It has succeeded so easily
against the older Japanese religion of Kami, or
hero-worship, because its introducers saw what
customs had become rooted in the Japanese heart,
and retained them. Thus we find the worship of
heroes, tolerated in the Buddhist faith, as well as
every spectacle and sound, calculated to please
the senses of the people. It also steered clear of
the rock upon which Christianity split (in Japan),
that is, the alienation of the people from their
rulers or sovereign.</p>
<p>Players of secular music, are numerous everywhere
in Japan, but few of them have any idea
of time or notation. Blind musicians (of the
fraternity above mentioned, and of another called
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
the Buffetz) are numerous and much encouraged
by the people, probably on account of their infirmity.
Women and girls form the bulk of the
secular players and singers. Most of these have
been brought up to this from childhood, and (as
with the ancient Greeks,) the possession of a
musical and literary education often goes hand in
hand with considerable laxity of morals.</p>
<p>The practice of music is, therefore, not held in
any great esteem among men, as the few males
who devote themselves to it are chiefly itinerants.
The secular songs are often plaintive in character,
but at times also quite stirring and fiery.</p>
<p>In Japan, as in some other Eastern countries,
it is not unusual to find persons among the upper
classes, who, while disdaining to study the art
themselves, yet are very fond of listening to the
performances of hired musicians. The taste
seems to run entirely in the direction of melody,
and not at all towards harmony; although they
have a knowledge of a rude kind of harmony,
consisting of melodies played upon two or more
instruments tuned a fifth apart, thus forming an
endless succession of consecutive fifths. This
harmony, or a plain melody played in unison, they
prefer to the finest (or, in fact, any) European
music. Our readers will recollect the answer
made by the Chinese mandarin to Pere Amiot,
relative to his opinion on the respective worth of
Chinese and European music. A similar reply was
given by a Japanese nobleman to Dr. M&uuml;ller,
when asked to give an opinion on our music,&mdash;&ldquo;European
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
music may please women, children,
and common people, but Japanese gentlemen may
not endure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In singing, the Chinese custom of using falsetto
tones, obtains also in Japan. One peculiar taste
for Western music exists among the Japanese;
they like, and purchase many of our music boxes,
and many are made in Switzerland especially for
the Chinese and Japanese market. These contain
two Chinese airs; but it is said that the people
would enjoy them even more, if there were no
harmonies attached. The entire instrumental
music of Japan, partakes of a tinkling character,
suggestive of a music box.</p>
<p>Secular singing is an indispensable adjunct of
banqueting and feasting. These are frequently
enlivened by songs and the sound of stringed
instruments.<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a></p>
<p>The Japanese have a great <i>penchant</i> for excursions,
banquets and lively enjoyments; they have
been, not inaptly, called the &ldquo;Parisians of the
West;&rdquo; hence it is not surprising to find houses of
entertainment scattered broadcast throughout the
realm. In these tea houses, every kind of dissipation,
from the most innocent, to the reverse, is
found, often under the same roof. The most
aristocratic of these resorts, have a numerous staff
of attendants, among which are singers, dancers,
and guitar-players. Although these establishments
appear disreputable in European eyes, yet the
Japanese gentleman does not hesitate to take his
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
wife and children thither, for a pleasure jaunt.
When we consider that the Japanese are the
most careful people in the world regarding the
education and behavior of their wives and children,
we cannot attribute this seeming incongruity to
negligence.</p>
<p>In tea houses of an inferior rank, when female
dancers and musicians are not among the assistants,
they may be sent for, and engaged by the hour.
These women never enter the lower class of tea-houses,
unless thus sent for. In this respect, as
well as by the correctness of their behavior, they
are to be distinguished from the lower order of
street musicians and dancers at fairs. These are
not allowed to perform in private houses; the law
compels them to confine their music to such
places as are subject to police regulations. Theatres
being included in this category, they often
appear there, at the request of performers in the
plays, in order to figure in the ballet.<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a></p>
<p>In Yeddo, many of the tea houses are built
along the banks of the river; and in this case, they
have large family boats or gondolas attached,
which they let out by the hour, to such parties
(and there are many) as desire to take their recreation
upon the water. Guitar players and refreshments
are furnished with these boats.</p>
<p>The lower classes are passionately fond of
listening to story tellers and singers, and these, as
in other Eastern countries, give open air performances,
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
trusting to their ability to delight their
audience, for a voluntary recompense.</p>
<p>Every day at the close of working hours, one
may see groups of artizans, and laborers, as well
as many women of the working classes, either at
the door of the workshop or at a street corner,
arranged in a semi-circle around the story-teller.</p>
<p>National legends and romances are usually given
only by those women who have made a profession
of music and singing. This branch of street
singers forms a large class; they are less roving
than the others, and sometimes of rather a high
order of talent, as compared with their more
itinerant associates. The most distinguished of
them have three or four musicians as accompanists,
and do not themselves play upon any instrument.
The effect of these combinations is said sometimes
to be very charming, when heard and seen on a
summer&rsquo;s evening, in a light bamboo frame work,
hung round with vines, and lighted with paper
lanterns.</p>
<p>Humbert has given the subject of some of these
legendary songs, and they are found to be of a
most sensational description. A few examples
will suffice to prove this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asahina-Sabro charges a troop of enemies,
and passes through them, lifting with his right
hand, a soldier wearing a casque and cuirass,
and spinning him round in the air, while with the
left hand he kills two equally redoubtable warriors
with one blow of his mace.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nitan-nosiro, the dauntless hunter, astride
on the back of a gigantic wild boar, which has
flung down, and trodden under its hoofs, all the
companions of the hero, holds the furious monster
between his knees, and plunges his cutlass into
its shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonsige, one of the horsemen of the Mikado,
finds his comrades squatting around a checker
board; he spurs his horse, and with one bound, it
stands in the centre of the board, as motionless as
any bronze equestrian statue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tame-tomo desired to conquer the island of
Fatsisis. As he mercifully desired to avoid bloodshed,
he set about convincing the islanders that
resistance was useless. He therefore summoned
the two strongest men of the race of the Ainos
(the ancient inhabitants of Japan) and, seated
calmly upon a mass of rock, he presented his bow
to them, holding it by the wood and ordering them
to try and bend it. Each seized it with both
hands, and setting their heels against the wood of
the bow, they leaned back with all their weight,
and pulled the string with all their strength.
Every effort was in vain; the bow only yielded
when Tame-tomo took it delicately between the
finger and thumb of his right hand, and shot an
arrow which was immediately lost in the clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be remembered, however, that these
highly spiced romances are the especial pabulum
of the lower classes; and it may be ranked considerably
higher than the musical recreation of the
working classes of China.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The laborers of Japan, sometimes sing while at
their toil, in a measured but cheerful manner.<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a>
Before leaving the subject of Japanese songs, it
may be interesting to note that in the days of
K&aelig;mpfer, the Japanese were as curious about
our songs, as we are to hear those of barbaric
nations; for the emperor and his court, insisted
upon that grave historian dancing, and singing
before them.<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a> On one of these interesting occasions
the historian basely deceived the imperial
Japanese searcher after knowledge; for on being
commanded to sing, he sang to the emperor, a
love ditty, which &ldquo;he had formerly composed
for a lady, for whom he had a particular esteem;&rdquo;
and upon the emperor inquiring the meaning of
the song, he answered that it was an ode of praise,
in honor of the emperor and his court.<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a> Let us
hope that the Japanese will not lead our investigators
astray in such a manner.</p>
<p>The court of Japan had, at that era, musicians
attached to its service, though by no means on the
grand scale of the Chinese court. The empress
had her private band, consisting of players upon
the birva, the koto, and the samsinn. Theatrical
representations were sometimes added to music.
A corps of young comedians played little operas,
or executed character dances, some grave and
slow, in which a long mantle was worn; others
lively and playful, the dancers appearing suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
and with appropriate movements, in the disguise
of birds or butterflies.</p>
<p>The court ladies had their private boxes at the
theatre and at the circus of wrestlers; many of
these customs still exist at the Japanese court
but not with the spirit and life of former days.</p>
<p>Processional music is, in Japan, similar to that
described in &ldquo;Chinese Music,&rdquo; noisy and distressing;
but it is by no means so generally used as in
China. In some processions it is not present at
all. The emperor formerly appears to have had
no music in his pompous cavalcades, for a description
of one of these pageants (written in the
seventeenth century), thus concludes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is at the same time in the utmost silence
that the procession proceeds. No one is heard to
speak a word. Neither the spectators in the
streets, nor those who form the procession, make
the least noise. It can only be perceived by the
sound of men&rsquo;s footsteps, and the tramping of
horses.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a></p>
<p>At the ecclesiastical processions, which take
place on days devoted to special <i>Kami</i>, (similar to
the saints days of Europe), and called <i>Matsouri</i>,
the music consists of the fifes, drums, and gongs
of the bonzery. Of course these processions vary
in proportion to the popularity of the special
Kami or saint. The greatest <i>Matsouri</i> which
takes place at Yeddo, is that given in honor of
Zinmou, the founder of the empire. Even those
who do not believe in Kami-worship, attend this
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
feast to show respect to their country, and it has
become a patriotic as well as religious occasion.
Over a million of spectators, annually view this
procession. In the ranks appear an image of the
patron of sacred dancing, borne on a large drum;
and the sacred gong of the priests. The band
on this occasion is large, and flutes, trumpets,
big drums, cymbals, gongs, and tambourines are
among the instruments carried. The expenses of
the lesser <i>Matsouri</i> are often defrayed by the
people of a street or quarter which is specially
devoted to the <i>Kami</i> in whose honor it is held.</p>
<p>Many of the customs above alluded to are sensibly
losing their hold on the populace, since the
recent introduction of our civilization; this is
especially the case with such customs as come
under government surveillance. The military
music for example, has been remodelled on the
European plan; regimental bands in French style
(that is with a preponderance of drums), are now
attached to the Japanese national army. The
trumpet calls are said to be played with much
aptitude by the Japanese performers, but in the
matter of time-keeping by the band, and keeping
step to the music by the soldiers, exactness is yet
far from being attained.<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a> In the theatre and its
music, there is, as yet, not so great a change from
former days, yet there are many European customs
to be found there (though probably not all derived
from Europe), and the theatre differs from that
of China, in having a curtain in front of the stage;
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
in being often built upon a permanent site; and
in other particulars.</p>
<p>The plays although sometimes quite as minute
in details as the Chinese, are much shorter, lasting
usually about two hours; and are often much
wittier.</p>
<p>There has been a peculiar manner of presenting
these plays; if five plays are to be performed in
one day, the following mode has sometimes been
adopted.<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a></p>
<p>The performers go through the first act of the
first play, then the first act of the second play,
and so on until the five <i>first acts</i> have been given.
They then take the <i>second</i> act of each play in
succession, and so on, until all the last acts are
given. The object of this custom is to enable
spectators to see one act, go away, and come again
in time for the next act.</p>
<p>Often, however, the spectators remain throughout
the entire day, and in that case refreshments
are openly consumed. It is also thought correct
for ladies to change their dress as often as possible
during the day, so that there is as much change of
costume, in front of the stage as upon it. In the
Japanese comedies there is generally a large
amount of love making. The tragedies deal
chiefly with the exploits of the mythological
heroes, and are expressed in verse, sometimes
declaimed, sometimes sung.<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a> The terrific combat
is an acknowledged essential of this order of
plays.<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>The effect of the martial scenes is much
increased by a bass drum, called &ldquo;taiko&rdquo; (after
a celebrated ancient warrior), which is sometimes
played with a smaller one called &ldquo;kakko.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a></p>
<p>The building where these plays take place is
very plain. The theatre at Matsmai, the capital
city of the Island of Jesso, is thus described.<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a large and pretty high building; at the
back is a stage which with us, has a raised floor.
From the stage to the front wall, where the
entrance is situated, two rows of seats are placed
for the spectators. In the middle where we have
the pit, there is a vacant space in which straw
mats are laid down for the spectators. As this
space is much lower than the stage, those in front
do not intercept the view from those behind.
Opposite the stage, where in our theatre the
galleries and chief boxes are situated there are
only a bare wall, and the door for entrance.</p>
<p>There were no ornaments in the interior; the
walls were not even painted. The dresses and
decorations are kept in a separate building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Yeddo this is far different and keeps more
pace with civilization, and, as Yeddo supplies the
surrounding provinces with both actors and plays,
the change is spreading throughout the empire.
The plays begin at six or seven, <span class="smaller">P. M.</span>, and last
(without the before-mentioned alternations) until
one or two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Theatres are
exceedingly numerous in the city; each has its
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
own arms or design, by which it is called; and
these are painted upon banners and lanterns,
which are hung from a tower upon the roof of
each establishment. We give as complement to
the above description of the Matsmai theatre, the
following picture of a leading theatre at Yeddo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interior of the theatre forms a long
square. There are two ranges of galleries, the
upper containing the best places in the theatre.
Numbers of ladies are to be seen there in full
dress, that is to say, covered up to their
eyes in crape dresses and silk mantles.<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a> The
whole of the remainder of the house is occupied
exclusively by men.</p>
<p>The floor of the house as seen from a distance,
resembles a draught board. It is divided into
compartments containing from eight to twelve
places each, most of which are hired by the year
by the citizens who take their children regularly
to the play. There are no lobbies. Every one
walks to his place on the planks which enclose the
compartments at the height of the spectators&rsquo;
shoulders, who squat on their heels, or crouch on
little stools. There is neither a ladder nor staircase,
by which to get down into the midst of them.
The men hold out their arms to the women and
children. The settling of the audience in its
place forms a very picturesque part in the preliminaries
of the representation. Tobacco and
refreshments are served during the whole evening
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
by koskeis, or servants, along the before-mentioned
gang planks. On two sides of the pit are two
bridges of planks, which also communicate with
the boards of the stage; the first is nearest to one
of the doors; the second, which is four planks
wide, forms an angle with the extremity of the
boxes. On this bridge certain heroic or tragic
comic personages perform their part, and the
ballet is danced. The house is lit by paper lanterns
tied to the galleries; there is no chandelier
from the roof, which is perfectly flat, the cupola
being unknown in Japanese architecture. Large
lanterns are however, sometimes held up to the
roof, in order to light up the performance of the
acrobats, especially that of the &lsquo;flying men,&rsquo;
who cross the theatre by means of cleverly
contrived mechanism.</p>
<p>The curtain which hangs before the stage, is
ornamented by a gigantic inscription in Chinese
characters, and surmounted by a target with an
arrow in the centre. This is a symbol of the
talent and tact which the actors are about to
display, and signifies that they expect to &lsquo;hit the
bull&rsquo;s eye&rsquo; of the audience&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a></p>
<p>The performance generally lasts till one o&rsquo;clock
<span class="smaller">A. M.</span>, and usually consists of a comedy, a tragedy,
an opera with a ballet, and two or three interludes
of acrobats, wrestlers and jugglers.</p>
<p>The tragedy we have already partly described
as of a mythological sensational type. In the
comedy it is often customary for the audience to
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
address the actors, and the latter answer in kind;
thus frequently a brisk fire of <i>repartee</i> is kept up
which delights the audience far more than the
play itself. It is very rare in any of these pieces
that more than two actors are upon the stage
together. In the ballet the performers are richly
attired, and sometimes wear several dresses of
light silk, one above the other; as they dance
they detach a few of these vestments and allow
them to hang from their waist, a cloud of airy
texture seemingly voluminous, but in reality very
light.<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a> The Japanese plays are sometimes preceded
by a prologue in which much of the action
is described (<i>a la</i> Greek chorus) but not the
<i>denouement</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a> The performance of the jugglers
is most to the popular taste, for it is not unusual
to find the restaurants (with which each theatre
is surrounded, and which cater to the same class
of custom) quite crowded during the entire performances,
but the moment that the gong gives
the signal for the commencement of the juggling,
they are at once deserted, every one hastening
back to his seat in the theatre. The principal
parts of the performance are announced not
with a bell or with music, but by striking a small
wooden stick upon the stage.</p>
<p>Sometimes the actors pass through the audience
on their way to the stage, in order to give the
spectators an opportunity to admire their appearance
and costume, as closely as possible.<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a> The
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
appearance of infernal personages on the stage is
always accompanied with lightning.</p>
<p>The principal characters of the drama are
accompanied on the stage by a couple of attendants,
each carrying a long stick at the end of
which is a lighted candle. The use of these
candles is amusing; they show to the audience
what they ought to admire. If the actor&rsquo;s facial
expression be peculiar, his attitude graceful, his
dress fine, or his weapons elegant, the candle is at
once held to the part, to attract attention.</p>
<p>With regard to the literary merit of the
Japanese drama, not enough is yet known whereon
to base a detailed analysis, but it is safe to say
that the art is yet in its infancy. It is singular,
that, while we regard some of the situations in
their plays as exceedingly indelicate, they, on
their part, condemn our drama as totally immoral,
and would not tolerate such plays as &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo;
&ldquo;School for Scandal,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The key to the enigma is this,&mdash;they allow every
license to unmarried ladies, but the married state
is with them inviolable. They therefore tranquilly
witness plays which would put &ldquo;Camille&rdquo; to the
blush, but allow nothing which involves post-marital
intrigue. Some of their actors are quite
skillful; there is one at present upon the Yeddo
stage, who performs the part of a man possessed
with the soul of a cat, and the blending of
human and feline character is said to be marvelous.</p>
<p>The caste of actors, as in China, is rather low;
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
the comedians being in least repute. Although
the theatre is so well patronized, yet it is only by
the middle and lower classes; very few aristocrats
even of the lesser nobility ever attending, and
these even disguise themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, it was to be imagined that the Jesuits
would not (at the time of their mission in Japan)
neglect so straight a road to the popular attention,
as the drama. In their church at Nagasaki (more
than two centuries ago), they represented a play
in the style of the medi&aelig;val miracle plays, representing
the birth of Christ. The parts were taken
by the neophites and native students at the college
of the order. Everything passed off in the
best possible manner, as well in the appointments
of the theatre, as in the ease and smoothness of
the acting, and it would have been applauded in
any European theatre.<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a></p>
<p>It may be interesting to the reader to peep into
the green room of a Japanese theatre, during
performance. It is thus described,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these places none but men are to be seen,
excepting from time to time some servants, or the
artists&rsquo; wives who bring refreshments to their
husbands, or come to give the last touch to their
toilet before they go on the stage in the costume
of either sex. In the midst of the general disorder
we find some very characteristic groups. Here
are musicians occupied in refreshing themselves,
and indifferent to everything else until the signal
to return to their posts shall reach them; there,
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
two actors are rehearsing together the attitudes
and gestures which in a few moments are to
delight the spectators; and another sitting on his
heels, before a looking glass placed upon the floor,
is painting his face and adjusting his feminine
head-dress. A young devil beside him, has thrown
back his mask, with his horns and mane over his
shoulders and is fanning himself, while the chief
of the wrestlers, is tranquilly smoking his pipe, in
the midst of the acrobats.</p>
<p>Among the crowd, carpenters are coming and
going, carrying the screens and partitions for the
next scene; the machinist is working a trap
through which a whirlwind of flame is about to
escape; and the piece is going on outside to the
accompaniment of drum beating, amid the conversation
of the public in the house, and that of
the disengaged actors.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a></p>
<p>Such briefly, is the condition of music and the
drama in Japan, but such astounding changes are
taking place throughout every part of the life of
this enterprising people, that a description which
is appropriate at present, may be a record of past
customs, ten years hence. Already there is a
tendency in upper circles towards Western music,
but this may be rather a result of fashion (which
is being rapidly <i>Europeanized</i>) rather than of
genuine appreciation; even the present empress of
Japan has, it is said, a real taste for European
music and instruments. She is a good performer
upon the piano-forte.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>As with the Chinese, the customs in general of
the Japanese are at total variance with our own;
to show respect we take off our hat, they their
shoes. We get up, they sit down, (it is the height
of impoliteness to receive a visitor standing.)<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a></p>
<p>We turn the back as a mark of incivility, they
as a token of respect;<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a> their mixture of the truest
modesty with the greatest license, must ever
remain an enigma to us. Since then, we cannot
in other respects, judge this remarkable people, it
behooves us, in the field of music, to study them
without preconceived ideas of the art. That
music is in an undeveloped state with them, is
undoubtedly true; the absence of treatises and
system proves it; but what direction the art will
take in its development can only be settled by
time. That it will not remain stationary in the
midst of change, is a foregone conclusion.</p>

<br />MUSIC OF SAVAGE NATIONS.</h2>
<p>The music of savage tribes, should properly
begin a chronological account of the music of
the world. It can scarce be doubted that the
strains which to-day delight the ears of the
rudest peoples, were similar to those which gave
pleasure to the uncultivated denizens of the earth
in pre-historic times. The scientific inquirer,
even to-day, finds unexpected points of resemblance
in music of nations and tribes, separated
from each other in distance, custom, climate and
religion; resemblances which are so numerous
that they can only be accounted for by the
hypothesis that the strains have come down from
an earlier, homogeneous race. Of course the
earliest efforts of primitive man were rather
rhythmical than musical, and even at present the
music of the least civilized races is altogether
rhythmical. The ease of the discovery that a
regular clapping of the hands, or stamping of the
feet, or striking two pieces of wood together,
could produce a pleasing effect, is so apparent
that it puts all discussion as to the origin of
music, out of sight; a fortunate occurrence, since
there are enough points of dispute yet left for our
wiseacres to contend over.</p>
<p>The discovery of drums and horns also came
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
almost directly from nature; and here the musical
instruments of primitive man stopped; and
here also (in drums, clappers of wood, and trumpets)
the catalogue of musical instruments, of the
more savage peoples, of the present, ceases.</p>
<p>But among the more advanced tribes of savages,
we shall find instruments that will cause us to
coincide with Solomon&rsquo;s opinion, that &ldquo;there is
nothing new under the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these, who did not stop contented at the
rude percussion and trumpet instruments, the
next step was probably to cut reeds of various
lengths and to discover that the length regulated
the tone. Here was the first real discovery in
music, for no sooner were high and deep tones
known than pleasant alternations would suggest
themselves, and as a consequence, melodies (however
uncouth) sprang into being. Possibly at
the same mystic era, the tension of the sinews
of some animal, left exposed to the breeze,
would fore-shadow string music. Then a thought
was required to find that the sounds varied with
tension of the sinews, and that a frame on which
several threads and sinews were extended in
different degrees of tension, could be made to
give the same variety of tones, but of different
quality of sound (<i>timbre</i>) from the reed pipes.
This already made demands upon the inventive
faculties, and in the infancy of music, as in the
modern orchestra, stringed instruments take the
lead.<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>It is improbable, however, that all nations went
the same road in these discoveries. Accident had
much to do with it. The conch shell, among a
tribe near the sea, the horn, with a hunting
people, and, with people situated near the
bamboo forests, the &ldquo;pans pipes,&rdquo; would be the
first of instruments. Instruments of the order of
flutes, were also of easy fabrication, and the
knowledge that they are so wide-spread among
savages all the world over, is internal evidence
that they were &ldquo;natural&rdquo; instruments.</p>
<p>Without sketching further the probable progress
of musical invention, we shall now describe some
of the instruments and songs used by the people
of the world who are yet in a state of nature.
But first let us mention some instruments, which
have been handed down to us from an immensely
remote and ante-civilized period.</p>
<p>The antiquarians in classifying the progress of
pre-historic races from their earliest emergence
from barbarism, have called that age, when the
use of metal became first known,&mdash;the Bronze
Age; as at that time smelting not being known,
the use of iron was not understood, and metal
implements were fashioned of copper, which
could be beaten by the hammer (of stone) into
the required shape, even when cold.</p>
<p>Of this mysterious epoch, a most interesting
relic has been discovered, in the shape of a musical
instrument. In a sepulchre, in a deep ravine,
in Schleswig, were found very recently, a number
of ornaments of bronze and gold (silver as well
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
as iron, was not then used), and also the horns
of many oxen. In the midst of this, lay a very
large <i>trumpet</i> of bronze; a sure token of the
existence of manufactured musical instruments,
thousands of years ago. This unique instrument
when blown, gives forth a deep, grave, and sonorous
tone. In common with all the barbarian
trumpets, it has but one tone. It is at present in
the Museum of Copenhagen, but was exhibited
at the Paris Exposition of 1867.<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a></p>
<p>The second of these instruments is more ancient
still. The age preceding the knowledge of the
uses of metal by early man, is called the Stone
Age. At this period the rude implements of use
and ornament were made either of soft substances,
such as wood, ivory, and horn, or else of stone.
Even in this crude epoch, instrumental music
seems to have existed, and not in its rudest form,
for a specimen has fortunately been preserved,
which, if authenticated fully, will show a degree
of musical taste at a most unexpected period. In
an ancient <i>dolman</i>, or sepulchre near Poictiers
was found a partly completed <i>flute</i> made of a
stag&rsquo;s horn. The distances of the holes, and
shape of the mouth-piece, show an aptitude of
construction and an experience in acoustics; but
the instrument evidently belongs to the later
period of the Stone Age.</p>
<p>But the third instrument is more interesting
yet. It was discovered by M. Lartet in a ravine,
along with bones of animals now extinct in
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
France. It is also a flute (straight, and with
mouth piece), with finger holes.<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> It is made of
the bone of a reindeer, which seems a proof positive
of its being made at a time when the climate
and zoology of France were totally different from
the present. From the skulls found in tombs and
caves of this period, it appears impossible that
man could have been developed sufficiently at
that time to construct an article of pleasure, such
as this. The skulls are said to greatly resemble
those of the present natives of Australia. Yet
their possessors must have had a vastly superior
intelligence to the latter.</p>
<p>It is no great leap in fact, although it may be in
time, to leave the savages of our own ancient
race, and describe the musical customs of the
savages of another, and inferior one. Therefore,
we will leave the discussion of the above three
instruments and their makers to Anthropological
and Ethnological societies, and pass on to the
examination of the barbarian of the present age.</p>
<p>One of the most curious facts in savage music
is to be found in New Zealand. It is almost
universally conceded that harmony was unknown
to Europeans until the tenth century; yet in
New Zealand for unknown ages, a combination of
simple thirds in a short vocal strain<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a> has been
known. It only illustrates the assertion of the
force of accident, in the rise of music.</p>
<p>Here was a savage tribe of cannibals who came
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
upon a most important musical idea (to be sure,
in a crude state, but still the germ of the
Harmonic theory) probably long before its acceptance
among civilized nations.</p>
<p>Another strange savage song is that which was
sung by the aborigines of Canada, at the time of
Cartier&rsquo;s taking possession in the name of the
King of France (<span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 1537). The curious fact
here, was not in the music, but in the words, in
as much as the word &ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo; occurred in it.
This strange coincidence made some early writers
conclude that the inhabitants were Hebrews,<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a>
probably the lost tribes; it is needless to say, that
the surmise, was not borne out by any further
researches.</p>
<p>In describing the music of barbarian races, we
find that its sister art, dancing, is closely connected
with it, and that it is impossible to separate
the two. In the lowest tribes, the dance is the
most prominent part of the musical efforts of the
people. The Australians, who are considered,
from the conformation of their skulls, and legs, to
be nearest to the brute creation, have many
interesting dances. The most important of these
is the &ldquo;Cobbongo Corrobboree,&rdquo; or great mystery
dance. It is performed by the inhabitants of the
far interior of the island. We subjoin the account
of a witness of this event.</p>
<p>The time selected for this great event is every
twelfth moon, and during her declination. For
several days previous, a number of tribes, whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
territories adjoin one another, congregate at a
particular spot, characterised by an immense
mound of earth, covered with ashes (known
amongst the white inhabitants as &ldquo;a black&rsquo;s
oven&rdquo;), and surrounded by plenty of &ldquo;couraway&rdquo;
or water holes.</p>
<p>To this place, they bring numbers of kangaroos,
possums, emus, and wild ducks, and a large
quantity of wild honey, together with a grass
from the seed of which they make a sort of bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the evening on which the &lsquo;corrobboree&rsquo;
is celebrated, a number of old men (one from each
tribe) called &lsquo;wammaroogo,&rsquo; signifying medicine-men,
or charm-men, repair to the top of the
mound, where, after lighting a fire they walk
round it, muttering sentences, and throwing into
it portions of old charms which they have worn
round their necks for the past twelve months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is continued for about half an hour,
when they descend, each carrying a fire-stick,
which he places at the outskirts of the camp, and
which is supposed to prevent evil spirits from
approaching. As soon as this is over, during
which a most profound silence is observed by all,
the men of the tribe prepare their toilets for the
&lsquo;corrobboree,&rsquo; daubing themselves over with
chalk, red ochre, and fat.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;While the men are thus engaged, the gentler
sex are busy arranging themselves in a long line,
and in a sitting posture, with rugs made of possum
skins, wound round their legs, and a small stick
called &lsquo;mulla mulla&rsquo; in each hand. A fire is lit
in front of them, and tended by one of the old
charmers. As the men are ready, they seat themselves,
cross-legged, like tailors, and in regular
serried file, at the opposite side of the fire to the
women, while one of the medicine-men takes up
his position at the top of the mound, to watch the
rising of the moon which is the signal for &lsquo;corrobboree.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All is now still; nothing disturbs the silence,
save the occasional jabber of a woman or child,
and even that, after a few minutes, is hushed.
The blaze of the fire throws a fitful light along
the batallion-like front of the black phalanx, and
the hideous faces, daubed with paint and smeared
with grease, show out at such a moment to anything
but advantage. As soon as the old gentleman
who has been &ldquo;taking the lunar&rdquo; announces
the advent of that planet, which seems to
exercise as great an influence over the actions of
these people, as over many of those amongst ourselves,
the &ldquo;corrobboree&rdquo; commences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women beat the little sticks together,<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a>
keeping time to a peculiar monotonous air, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
repeating the words, the burden of which may be
translated in this manner,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The kangaroo is swift,</p>
<p class="t">But swifter is Ngoyulloman;</p>
<p class="t0">The snake is cunning,</p>
<p class="t">More cunning is Ngoyulloman, etc.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Each woman using the name of her husband, or
favorite in the tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men spring to their feet with a yell that
rings through the forest, and brandishing their
spears, and boomerangs commence their dance,
flinging themselves into all sorts of attitudes,
howling, laughing, grinning, and singing; and
this they continue until sheer exhaustion compels
them to desist, after which they roast and eat the
product of the chase gathered for the occasion,
and then drop off to sleep one by one.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a></p>
<p>We have already expressed our opinion that
the dance (pantomimic) first sprang into existence
when some savage finding his own limited
language (perhaps even, he had none) inadequate
to describe to his companions, some deed of hunting
or war which he had performed, reproduced
the feat in actions, to give a more perfect understanding
of it. If song be as old as speech,
dancing may be said to be as old as gestures.</p>
<p>We are not surprised, therefore, to find among
the Australians, dances which represent such
events. In the &ldquo;frog dance,&rdquo; the performers
paint themselves as usual, and then, squatting
upon their haunches, jump around in a circle
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
imitating the motions of the frog. The &ldquo;Emu
dance&rdquo; represents the chase after that swift
running bird. The performer who takes the part
of the Emu, imitates its fleet, long strides, and
gives out the low rattling drumming sound which
is the bird&rsquo;s only note.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;canoe dance&rdquo; men and women stationed
in two lines, imitate the graceful motions of
paddling a canoe.</p>
<p>There is a dance &ldquo;with partners&rdquo; prevalent in
the southern part of Australia. Both sexes
participate in it. Each man carries a belt of
possum skin, or human hair, which he keeps
stretched tight, holding one end in each hand.
The men all sit down in a circle while a woman
takes her place in the middle; one of the men
then dances up to her, jumping from side to side,
and swaying his arms in harmony with his movements.
The woman also begins swaying and
jumping in time with him, as he approaches her,
and after a short <i>pas de deux</i> they dance back to
their places, while the centre is occupied by a
fresh couple.</p>
<p>A strange dance was celebrated by the Tasmanians
at each full moon. The various tribes
assembled at some trysting place, and while the
women prepared the fire, and fenced off a space
for the dance, the men retired to adorn themselves
with paint, and to fasten branches of bushy
twigs to their ankles, wrists and waists. The
women being seated at the front of the space,
one of the oldest among them, strode forward,
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
calling by name, one of the performers, whom she
reviled as a coward, and challenged to come
forward and meet her charge, and answer it.</p>
<p>The warrior was swift enough in his response,
and, bounding through the fire, into the circle, he
recounted his deeds of valor in both chase and
war. At every pause he made, his female admirers
took up the list of his praises, vaunting his actions
in a sort of chant which they accompanied with
extemporized drums, made of rolled kangaroo
skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly upon some inspiring allegro movement
of the thumping hand, thirty or forty grim
savages would hound successively through the
furious flames, into the sacred arena, looking like
veritable demons on a special visit to <i>terra firma</i>;
and, after thoroughly exhausting themselves, by
leaping in imitation of the kangaroo, around and
through the fire, they vanish in an instant. After
this, the old lady who was the origination of all
the hubbub, gave a signal, upon which, all the
females rose, and quite unadorned, gave a series
of acrobatic performances around the fire, that
were strange and wonderful to behold. The main
point being however, with each of them, to outscream
her sister singers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a></p>
<p>In the dances of Australia and Tasmania, only
the rudest instruments of percussion are used,
and the chants are not musical, though sometimes
(rarely) the attitudes are graceful. A far more
musical and poetical people, are the New Zealanders
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
who as we have already mentioned, intuitively
knew of harmony before the Europeans.
Many of their love, war, and religious songs have
real sentiments of beauty in them, and the gift of
improvising poems and songs is much prized
among them. Singular to state, they (unlike all
other savage races) do not use the drum in their
accompaniment. The <i>pahu</i> (drum) is only used
by them to give military signals.<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a> Their chief
instrument is the flute, which is usually made from
a human thigh bone; often that of a fallen enemy.
When this is the case, the instrument is more
than ordinarily prized, and is worn around the
neck. It is played through the nose, by placing
the nostril against the aperture, and blowing;
stopping the other nostril with the finger.</p>
<p>The native New Zealander sings in all his
sports and labours, and in spite of his <i>penchant</i>
for human flesh, is of a light and joyous temperament.
Every incident of war, chase or love is
commemorated by an extemporized song. Sometimes
these songs live for generations after their
signification has passed away; and thus it is, that
in many of the songs of this people, words are
found, of which, neither the singers nor audience
understand the meaning. One song (<i>E&rsquo;Haka</i>) is
accompanied with much mimicry; when giving
this, the performers sit down in a circle, throw off
their upper mats, and sing in concert, making
meanwhile the wildest of gestures, and turning
up their eyes so that only their whites are visible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Their canoe song is very animating, and is often
accompanied by the primitive nose flute mentioned
above.</p>
<p>The words (improvised) are such as &ldquo;pull
away! pull away! pull away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dig into the
water.&rdquo; &ldquo;Break your backs,&rdquo; etc., and are
shouted with stentorian lungs, but not unmusically.</p>
<p>But their greatest song and dance is the war-dance.
In this they far excel all other savage
tribes the world over. Their movements although
extremely violent, are made with a precision and
unity, to which all other races are strangers. A
description of this unique performance speaks of
it as follows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They begin by smearing the whole of their
clothing and painting their faces with scarlet
ochre, so as to make themselves as hideous as
possible. When they assemble for the dance they
arrange themselves in lines usually three deep,
and excite their naturally passionate dispositions
to the highest pitch by contorting their faces, and
thrusting out their tongues as an act of defiance,
interspersing these gestures with shouts, yells and
challenges to the enemy. The dance itself begins
with stamping the feet in perfect time with each
other, the vigor of the stamp increasing continually,
and the excitement increasing in similar
proportion. Suddenly with a yell, the whole body
of men leap sideways into the air, as if actuated
by one spirit, and as they touch the ground, come
down on it with a mighty stamp that makes the
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
earth tremble. The war song is raised, and in
accordance with its rhythm, the men leap from
side to side, each time coming down with a thud,
as of some huge engine.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a></p>
<p>The New Zealander often entertains himself
with sham fights,<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a> but nothing has so intense an
effect upon him as the music and action of this
rhythmic war-dance. Even when actual war is
not impending, he will enter into it with a vigor
that is terrible. It transforms him for the time
into a monomaniac, and absorbs his whole
nature; even when the dance is given in honor
of a stranger, it is dangerous to go too near the
Maori (native New Zealander) until he has
become more tranquil.</p>
<p>On one occasion a party of New Zealanders,
visiting a European ship, were requested to give an
exhibition of their war-dance on board. They
did so, beginning without much excitement, but
gradually their leaps became so fierce and powerful
that the captain was afraid that they would
break the deck; he begged of them to desist, but
in vain; he might as well have spoken to a whirlwind.
His voice was drowned in the shouts and
singing of the frenzied warriors. The chief of
the party, showed the influence of its charms, in
a ludicrous manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>He had been presented on his arrival, with a
full suit of naval uniform, and he stalked around
the deck, in all the dignity of new clothes. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
cheerfully allowed his followers to begin the war-dance,
but he himself looked on with conscious
dignity; but after the excitement had continued a
few minutes, he too was drawn into its vortex.
At first a gentle swaying of his body, in time with
the music was all: then a little <i>sotto voce</i> singing,
then he joined in the rhythm stamping, and
finally, forgetting his new finery, he sprang into
line and danced more enthusiastically than any of
them; so much so, that the clothes soon split, and
at the end of the dance he presented a very seedy
appearance. It is needless to say that the dance
could not in any way be checked, and found its
conclusion only when all the dancers were reduced
to a state of complete exhaustion.</p>
<p>With all savage people, song, dance and poetry
are indissolubly united; a fact which goes far to
prove the &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; of the old Greek music.
In the Malaysian archipelago we find a similar
style of music, to that described above; but we
find the natural instrument of barbarians, the
drum, far more plentifully used.</p>
<p>The Javanese have two kinds of drums, both
made of copper, but differing in size and pitch.
The sound is like that of a distant bell, and as
they are used in sets, the compass often reaches
an octave. The larger set, called <i>Salendro</i> contains
but five tones in this interval; the general
effect of this set is <i>major</i>. The smaller set, called
<i>Pelog</i>, contains seven drums to the octave, and is
minor in style. The natives themselves speak of
the <i>Salendro</i> as being masculine, and the <i>Pelog</i> as
being more tender and feminine in its <i>effect</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>The songs of Java (as also of other islands in
the Malay archipelago) are strongly suggestive of
the Scotch popular ballads, and can readily be
reproduced in our scale.</p>
<p>It is not customary to sing the written poems,
with an instrumental accompaniment unless there
is dancing simultaneously. As in French poetry
and song, many letters, usually mute, are sounded,
so in the Javanese much license of pronunciation
is allowed in song, which would be condemned in
prose. There are some traces of inflection and
accent, altering the meaning of a word; thus
&ldquo;<i>boten</i>&rdquo; signifies &ldquo;<i>no</i>,&rdquo; but when the accent is
placed on the first syllable, it signifies a haughty
or peremptory refusal, but when on the latter, a
mild and regretful one.</p>
<p>The Javanese have three styles of musical
compositions, the great, medium, and lesser. The
latter is used for the popular songs, the former for
the higher flights of poetry.</p>
<p>Very often one can hear an old native, on a
holiday occasion, singing of the great deeds of the
ancient princes; the subjects of his ballads, are
often borrowed from the <i>babads</i>, or popular
legends of the country, and he accompanies himself
with a species of stringed instrument. He
sings of the glories and fall of the kingdom of
Pad-jad-jaran, and praises and laments those royal
heroes. Many of the love songs of the Malays
are written in the form of question and answer,
as follows,&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where do the swallows go to bathe?</p>
<p class="t0">They go to bathe in the forest brook.</p>
<p class="t0">What has my loved one promised to me?</p>
<p class="t0">She has promised to chat a little with me,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p>This questioning and answering is not confined
to their music, for the Javanese are passionately
fond of conundrums.<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a> The imagery of their
poems and songs is of the simplest and most
natural description, fields, flowers, trees, rivers,
etc., appear <i>ad infinitum</i> in their literature.<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a>
Their early historical legends are full of Gods in
human form, of giants, and miracles; somewhat
resembling in this the Hindoo allegories.</p>
<p>Theatrical representations, of course form a
large part of both Malaysian and Polynesian popular
amusements. In Java, national history is
preserved not only by the ballads, but by pantomimic
representations; in the latter, little puppets
made of leather, wood, or paper, and sometimes
masked performers, appear. The performance is
accompanied by orchestral music, certain stringed
instruments of which are only played by women.
Some of the representations are given at night
behind a white curtain, and resemble what, with
us, are called, &ldquo;shadow pantomimes;&rdquo; these are
performed mostly by females, and often last all
night, breaking up, at times, as late as six in the
morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>At all Javanese <i>fetes</i>, music is played, and
every native is expected to entertain such wandering
musicians as apply to him. A refusal is apt to
cost dearly, as the irate musicians stone the dwelling
of the obdurate one.<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a></p>
<p>M. Scherzer, connected with the Austrian
Round-the-world expedition in 1857 (in the frigate
Novara), was not highly delighted with the
Javanese pantomime dancing and music;<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a> he
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conversation was carried on with difficulty,
for an incessant and stupefying noise was kept
up with the <i>gammelong</i>, or orchestra of bells.
Bayaderes, very scantily clothed, and excessively
ugly, executed sentimental and religious dances
of a most tedious description.</p>
<p>Stiff, slow, and thin, these damsels jumped like
forks, with motions as graceful as those of old
semaphores. The governor was kind enough to
explain to us, that the dance was meant to represent
the touching history of four sisters, who, lost
in the forest, implored from the divinity the
return of their mother.</p>
<p>This was followed by another choregraphic
entertainment, a dance of eight warriors, accompanied
by the perpetual <i>gammelong</i>. The same
delectable music, delighted the ears of those who
were without in the court-yard. Hideous masks,
on foot and on horseback, circulated there amidst
the crowd; a Mussulman priest was also howling
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
fearfully, as he danced on hot ashes, near to a
mass of burning wood; others jumped in and
danced away frantically. At last the priest himself
joined them, and the shouts and gesticulations
became furious. This representation had
probably some signification of religious expiation,
at least it would have been deemed as such in
ancient mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this followed conjuring tricks of a wonderful,
though sanguinary description, &ldquo;and then
the infernal <i>gammelong</i> began again.&rdquo; Then
came excellent fireworks. &ldquo;At last the <i>gammelong</i>
ceased its stunning noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During Captain Cook&rsquo;s voyage round the world,
Banks and Solander, two of his best associates
witnessed (<span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 1769) a pantomime in one of the
Society islands. It was of a comic nature, and
contained music and dancing. The subject was
the adventures of a thief, including his capture.<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a>
In Cook&rsquo;s second voyage, Forster observed a comic
opera in the Society islands, which appear closely
allied to the above. Actors and actresses appeared
in this play, the first act of which concluded with
a burlesque beating of three of the participants.
The commencement of the second act was
announced by the musicians beating their drums.<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a></p>
<p>In the Tonga islands, the actors of these musical
dramas recite sentences which are answered by
a chorus of singers. There is a great variety in
their movements and groupings. Occasionally
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
they sing slowly, and afterwards quickly for about
a quarter of an hour. Sometimes they form a
semi-circle, assume a bending position, and sing
in a subdued tone of voice, a soft air, which is
soon followed again by a loud and vehement
declamation.</p>
<p>It is a singular fact that some of the races most
addicted to cannibalism are also much addicted to
music. We have seen this already in the case of
the New Zealanders; it will be fully as apparent
with the most cannibalistic race of the globe,&mdash;the
Fiji Islanders. With them, music teaching is a
remunerative art, and any one who has composed
a new song or dance, can earn a large quantity of
goods by teaching it. Their musical instruments
are poor and few; they consist of pipes, flutes,
drums, and trumpets. The trumpets are merely
conch shells, blown through an aperture in the
side.</p>
<p>The flutes are nose-flutes, played by putting the
aperture under one nostril, closing the other with
the thumb of the left hand, and blowing. The
pipes are a species of pandean pipes made of
bamboo.</p>
<p>The dances are very carefully got up, and more
resemble military movements than dances, the
similitude being increased by the martial array of
the dancers, who are all dressed as if for war,
their faces painted with scarlet, their bodies
powdered black, and their best clubs or spears in
their hands. They execute intricate man&oelig;uvres,
marching in various figures, wheeling, halting,
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
and stamping their feet in exact time to the
rhythm of the song, and the beat of the drum.</p>
<p>Sometimes several hundred men are engaged in
the dance, while the musicians are twenty or thirty
in number. The scene at one of these dances is
very picturesque, but it wants the furious energy,
which gives such fiery animation to the war-dance
of the New Zealanders; the movements, though
correct in point of time, being comparatively
dull and heavy. In order to enliven it a little
more, a professional buffoon is usually introduced
upon the scene, who performs sundry grotesque
movements, and is usually applauded for his exertions.
Music and dancing are always used at the
celebration of a marriage.<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a> Mr. Seeman in a
recent work<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a> says of the entertainment called
<i>Kalau Rere</i>, that, &ldquo;with its high poles, streamers,
evergreens, [these cannibals are very tasty in
their personal adornments, wreaths of flowers,
evergreens, etc., being much used], masquerading,
trumpet shells, chants, and other wild music, is
the nearest approach to dramatic representation,
the Fijians seem to have made, and it is with
them, what private theatricals are with us. Court
fools, in many instances hunchbacks, are attached
to the chief&rsquo;s establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music of the remaining races of Oceanica,
does not differ very materially from the above-described
forms. Many of the instruments found
in use among the Malays, have had their origin in
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
China and India,<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a> and therefore the description of
them has not been made so minute as that of the
instruments of those countries. Summed up
briefly, we find that the taste for rhythm is <i>every
where</i> prevalent; for instruments of percussion,
almost so, (the New Zealanders forming a notable
exception here), and that the prevailing impulse
of these races, on hearing rhythmic music, is to
dance.</p>
<p>We now proceed to the examination of the
music of another large division of the human
race.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br />AFRICAN MUSIC.</h2>
<p>In describing the music of the natives of Africa,
we will place in contrast the modes of the two
extremes of the scale of intelligence.</p>
<p>The Kaffir is certainly as far in advance of the
Bushman, as we are in advance of the native
Indian. The Kaffir is peculiar in music; very
deficient in melody, he is almost perfect in rhythm
and time-keeping. He is fond of singing in company,
and in fact is a rather convivial person
altogether. At social meals, while the food is
cooking, the guests often amuse themselves by
singing together until the repast is in readiness.
The subjects of the songs are various; love songs,
and war songs being held in equal favor, but the
Kaffir is always specially pleased with any song
that relates to the possession of cattle; and being
a cattle-owning people, they have many songs
celebrating their favorite subject.</p>
<p>Many of the Kaffir&rsquo;s musical effects would seem
most ludicrous to us. Sudden contrasts, have, to
him, a special attraction, and it is not unusual to
hear him give the highest squeaks of falsetto,
and the deepest bass grunts, alternately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Loudness in singing is his great end and aim,
and to effect sudden <i>sforzando</i> effects, he has a
peculiar method, i. e.&mdash;the choruses of the songs
are usually meaningless, being often a mere
reiteration of the words e-e-e-<i>yu</i> (which may be
called the African &ldquo;fol de roi de ray&rdquo;), and
when, after shouting with full lungs on the <i>e-e-e</i>, the
singer desires more power on the <i>yu</i>, he effects it
by giving himself a sound thump in the ribs with
his elbows; this produces a marked emphasis on
the syllable, and the result, when two or three
hundred singers do this simultaneously is startling.
The Kaffir, contrary to our practise, <i>sits
down</i>, when he sings.</p>
<p>One of their favorite songs, is used at husking
festivals. &ldquo;The dry heads of maize are thrown
in a heap upon the hard and polished floor of the
hut, and a number of Kaffirs sit in a circle round
the heap, each being furnished with the ever
useful <i>knobkerry</i> (a stick or club, very like a
<i>shillelagh</i>, but with a knob at one end). One of
them strikes up a song, and the others join in full
chorus beating time with their clubs, upon the
heads of the maize. This is a very exciting
amusement for the performers, who shout the
noisy chorus at the highest pitch of their lungs,
and beat time by striking their knobkerries upon
the grain. With every blow of the heavy club
the maize grains are struck from their husks, and
fly about the hut in all directions, threatening
injury, if not absolute destruction to the eyes of
all who are present in the hut. Yet the threshers
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
seem to enjoy an immunity which seems to be
restricted to themselves and blacksmiths; and
while a stranger is anxiously shading his eyes
from the shower of hard maize grains, the
threshers themselves do not give a thought to the
safety of their eyes, but sing at the top of their
voices, pound away at the corn cobs, and make the
grains fly in all directions, as if the chorus of the
song were the chief object in life, and the preservation
of their eyesight were unworthy of a
thought.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a></p>
<p>The war-songs of the Kaffirs are fiery and
exciting, though in a less degree than those of
New Zealand.</p>
<p>Their poetry is full of metaphor, and alliterative
enough to be admitted into the opera
of the future. The participants sit in a circle,
sometimes three or four deep, with their knees
well drawn up, and sing, beating rhythmic accompaniment
upon the ground, twirling their <i>assagais</i>
(javelins), and occasionally enlivening the proceedings
with an ear-piercing whistle, or deafening
shout.</p>
<p>We give an English version (Mr. Shooter&rsquo;s)
of two of these, merely premising that much of
the native beauty is said to be lost in the transposition
to a foreign tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>

</div>
<p>The other is an Alexandrian lament of the lack

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou hast finished, finished the nations!</p>
<p class="t0">Where will you go out to battle now?</p>

<p class="t0">Where are you going to battle now?</p>
<p class="t0">Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!!</p>
<p class="t0">Where are you going to battle now?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>From the extracts it will be seen that flattery is
not confined to European courts; the Kaffir carries
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
it still further, for in addition to his own proper
name (which it is deemed ill omened to speak)
everybody of any rank, receives a number of <i>isi-bonges</i>
or praise-names, alluding to some action
or peculiarity. It is customary on all formal
occasions, to recite several of these <i>isi-bonges</i>,
just as a European nobleman on official ceremonies
desires to have all his titles proclaimed. In
songs, of course, the invention of these is unlimited.
Thus the great Panda, a renowned ruler of
enormous fatness, is spoken of as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A swallow which fled in the sky,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A swallow with a whiskered breast,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ramrod of brass,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thigh of the bullock of Inkakavini.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou art an <i>Elephant</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Monarch who art black,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<p>Such songs of praise are sung with great relish
by full choruses. Violent gestures are used to
heighten the effect. The songs are in unison, no
harmonic divisions being attempted.</p>
<p>The instruments of the Kaffir are few and crude;
the whistle before mentioned, although giving but
one tone, is a great favorite. It is so shrill that
it can be heard above the wildest din of the
<i>ensemble</i>.</p>
<p>A rude flute or flageolet is also sometimes
used; but the most-used instrument, is a primitive
harp with <i>one string</i> only, and whose tones though
light and sweet can scarcely be heard at six yards
distance. It is an ordinary bow with a string of
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
twisted hair, and a hollow gourd attached at the
centre of the wood to give resonance. A ring is
passed along the string, to raise or lower the tone,
which is produced by striking the cord with a
short stick, or <i>plectrum</i>. The bow is about five
feet long, and exactly resembles the usual weapon,
which however is not used in war by the Kaffirs.</p>
<p>Although the resources of this instrument are
so extremely limited, the musicians of this people
are content to sit for hours, listening to its monotonous
sound.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the degraded black brother
of the foregoing race, the Bushman. His amusements
are two;&mdash;singing and dancing.</p>
<p>The dance of the Bushman is to European eyes
a most uninteresting one; as there is scarcely any
motion or gesture at all in it, save that which is
made by <i>one leg</i>. Standing on one foot, the
performer shakes the other, (to which a string of
rattles, made from the ears of the spring-bok are
attached) occasionally giving his body a twist, and
singing vigorously all the while, changing the
foot, however, from time to time.</p>
<p>The spectators keep the rhythm by a constant
and regular clapping of hands and a monotonous
singing.</p>
<p>A water-drum, which is merely a wooden bowl,
into which a little water has been poured, and
over which a skin is tightly drawn, is struck
regularly in time with the movements of the
dancer; the latter when partially exhausted, falls
upon the floor, but still singing and kicking in time
with the music; after a short rest of this description,
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
he jumps up and continues as at first. When
utterly exhausted, he retires among the spectators
and unfastening his leg-rattles, hands them to the
next dancer. The music to this odd performance
is <i>not</i> in unison; the dancer sings one air, the
spectators another, and the drum gives a species
of &ldquo;ground bass&rdquo; to the whole.</p>
<p>While engaged in this interesting occupation of
shaking one leg, the Bushman is completely
oblivious of all other considerations, as if he were
entranced. Discordant as the music seems to us
when annotated by the travellers who have heard
it, yet these same authorities are almost unanimous
in declaring that the effect is extremely
pleasant.</p>
<p>The most peculiar instrument of the Bushmen,
is the <i>goura</i>, which is shaped like a bow, but has
at one end of the string, a piece of quill inserted;
this quill is blown upon in the same manner that
we use a jew&rsquo;s-harp. Women play upon this
instrument, but hold it perpendicularly, and do
not breathe upon it, but strike it with a stick, and
then catch it up, quickly to their ear, to listen to
the tones. When thus played, it is called, a <i>joum-joum</i>.</p>
<p>All the airs played upon this primitive instrument
seem to come by chance rather than skill,
and the performer never seems able to play the
same tune twice. But the same or better music
could be drawn from a much more compact and
portable instrument; therefore the <i>goura</i> has now
been almost superseded by a European competitor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
and the favorite instrument of the African
Bosjesman now is the <i>Jew&rsquo;s-harp</i>.</p>
<p>They also possess a rude banjo-like instrument
from which comparatively fair music could be
produced, but the Bushmen are content to strum
it without method, and take the music as fortune
sends it. A drum completes the list of Bushman
instruments; it is sometimes played with sticks
and sometimes with the fist. It can be heard at a
considerable distance.</p>
<p>In contrasting these two extremes of African
races, it is singular to remark, that the superiority
in music, if there be any, must be conceded to the
lower race.</p>
<p>We find much that is curious and worthy of
note in the music of those mysterious tribes of
central Africa, who have so recently become
known to us through the researches of Schweinfurth,
Stanley, and Baker.</p>
<p>Among the best known of these tribes, may be
mentioned the Nyam-Nyams, a set of most inveterate
cannibals, whose very name comes from the
sound of gnawing at food, and was given them on
account of their man-eating propensities. Their
chief musical instruments are mandolins or small
harps of four strings each, drums (mostly of wood,)
bells of iron, whistles and pipes. Many of these
instruments are very symmetrically formed, and
tastily carved, for in wood, iron, and clay designing
the Nyam-Nyams are very expert. Schweinfurth
thus describes their
music,<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;They
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
have an instinctive love of art. Music
rejoices their very soul. The harmonies they
elicit from their favorite instrument, the mandolin,
seem almost to thrill through the chords of their
inmost nature. The prolonged duration of some
of their musical productions is very surprising.&rdquo;
Piaggia has remarked that he believed a &ldquo;Nyam-Nyam
would go on playing all day and all night,
without thinking to leave off either to eat or
to drink,&rdquo; and although quite aware of the voracious
propensities of the people, it seems very
probable that he was right.</p>
<p>One favorite instrument there is, which is something
between a harp and a mandolin. It resembles
the former in the vertical arrangement of its
strings, whilst in common with the mandolin, it
has a sounding-board, a neck, and screws for
tightening the strings.</p>
<p>The sounding board is constructed on strict
acoustic principles. It has two apertures; it is
carved out of wood, and on the upper side it is
covered with a piece of skin; the strings are
tightly stretched by means of pegs, and are sometimes
made of fine threads of bast, and sometimes
of the wiry hairs from the tail of the giraffe.</p>
<p>The music is very monotonous and it is difficult
to distinguish any melody in it. It invariably is
an accompaniment to a moaning kind of recitative
which is rendered with a decided nasal intonation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not unfrequently seen friends marching
about arm in arm, wrapt in the mutual enjoyment
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
of the performance, and beating time to every
note by nodding their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a singular class of professional
musicians who make their appearance decked out
in the most fantastic way, with feathers, and
covered with a promiscuous array of bits of wood
and roots, and all the pretentious emblems of
magical art, the feet of earth-pigs, the shell of
tortoises, the beaks of eagles, the claws of birds,
and teeth in every variety. Whenever one of this
fraternity presents himself, he at once begins to
recite all the details of his travels and experiences,
in an emphatic recitative, and never forgets to
conclude by an appeal to the liberality of his
audience, and to remind them that he looks for a
reward either of rings of copper, or of beads.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a></p>
<p>With some slight differences these men may be
found throughout Africa; almost everywhere
they are sought for and their talents enjoyed, but
they themselves held in contempt. Among the
Nyam-Nyams, their appellation in itself (&ldquo;Nzangah&rdquo;)
implies contempt, being similar to that
which is applied to despised and outcast women.</p>
<p>Contrary to the custom of almost all other
savages, the Nyam-Nyams delight most in gentle
music; some of the minstrels sing so softly that it
is impossible to hear them a few yards off. The
light Mandolin accompaniment is in good accord
with this <i>pianissimo</i> style of music.</p>
<p>Their dances, given by male and female performers,
are wonderfully swift, intricate and
pleasant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>A great &ldquo;Congo&rdquo; or dance was given by some
of these people to Col. C. Chaill&eacute; Long, an
American officer on the staff of the Khedive of
Egypt, who made a very interesting expedition to
the Makraka Nyam-Nyams, and Lake Victoria
Nyanza in 1874. He thus describes the scene:&mdash;<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Invitations had been sent to all the Nyam-Nyam
lasses, who came even from as far as
Parafio, and did honor to the occasion by brightening
up their copper and iron fastenings, and in
putting on fresh fig leaves. The loose bands that
encased their ankles, kept perfect time in loud
clanking sound to music really euphonious, and of
a symphony that my unmusical ear I regret cannot
translate here, evoked from a Sinon-like
wooden horse, that was beaten on its sides with
drum-sticks, or by parallel banana trees that were
traversed by different sized pieces of dry wood,
upon which several performers beat successively.</p>
<p>This musical instrument, as well as drums and
horns, the latter made of Elephants&rsquo; tusks, were
very similar to those I had seen at Ugunda....</p>
<p>The Sheik, a robust, powerfully developed man,
led his brave warriors in the dance, holding in his
hand, a curiously-shaped sword, his insignia of
office, whilst the round little forms of hundreds
of Nyam-Nyam maidens followed, each with giddy
swiftness as the &ldquo;cancan&rdquo; fantasia became fast
and furious. The festivity continued until the
&lsquo;wee sma hours&rsquo; of the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trumpets of the Nyam-Nyam are more
generally used as war signals than as musical
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
instruments; they are blown through a hole in the
side, and not at the end; therefore the mode of
performing upon them, rather resembles our style
of flute playing.<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a></p>
<p>Another musical nation of Central Africa is
the Karague; travellers who have visited them
have given more or less detailed accounts of their
instruments and festivities. Capt. Speke had the
unusual honor of a serenade from the royal court
band. The king after receiving a present of some
beads, cloth wire, and a tin box, was so delighted
that he sent his own band to give Speke a tune.</p>
<p>The performers used reed instruments (made in
telescopic fashion) and marked the time by hand-drums.
At first they marched and countermarched,
playing meanwhile much in the manner of
Turkish regimental bands; but this was soon
changed to a species of &ldquo;horn-pipe,&rdquo; which all
the musicians danced, playing furiously meanwhile.<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a></p>
<p>Another bit of musical ceremony which Speke
witnessed, will at once remind the reader of the
great &ldquo;Zapfenstreich&rdquo; or grand tattoo practised
sometimes in the German army. At the new
moon the king surrounds himself with numerous
drummers (Speke saw thirty-five); these strike up
together, gradually increasing to a deafening noise;
this is followed by a milder kind of music, similar to
that described above. The object of the ceremony
is to call in all the king&rsquo;s warriors to renew their
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
oath of fealty.<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a> The time keeping is said to be
very exact, and the drummers burst forth again
and again during the night. The war drum of the
Karague is beaten by women.</p>
<p>A kind of guitar exists among this people, and
six of the seven strings which it possesses accord
perfectly with our own diatonic scale, the seventh
string only, being discordant. Their wind instruments
are flageolet and bugle, or at least similar
to them.</p>
<p>Among the nations adjacent to those already
mentioned are the Bongo.</p>
<p>We again quote from the valuable work of the
most musical traveller who has visited this section,&mdash;Schweinfurth.<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bongo, in their way are enthusiastic
lovers of music; and although their instruments
are of a very primitive description, and they are
unacquainted even with the pretty little guitar of
the Nyam-Nyams, which is constructed on perfectly
correct acoustic principles, yet they may be
seen at any hour of the day, strumming away and
chanting to their own performances. The youngsters
down to the small boys are all musicians.
Without much trouble and with the most meagre
materials they contrive to make little flutes; they
are accustomed also to construct a monochord,
which in its design reminds one of that which
(known as the Gubo of the Zulus) is common
throughout the tribes of Southern Africa. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
consists of a bow of bamboo, with the string
tightly strained across it, and this is struck by a
slender slip of bamboo.</p>
<p>The mouth of the player performs the office of
sounding board; he holds the instrument to his
mouth with one hand, and manages the string
with the other. Performers may often be seen
sitting for hours together with an instrument of
this sort; they stick one end of the bow into the
ground, and fasten the string over a cavity covered
with bark, which opens into an aperture for
the escape of the sound. They pass one hand
from one part of the bow to the other, and with
the other they play upon the string with the
bamboo twig, and produce a considerable variety
of buzzing and humming airs which are really
rather pretty. This is quite a common pastime
with the lads who are put in charge of the goats.
I have seen them apply themselves very earnestly
and with obvious interest to their musical practice,
and the ingenious use to which they apply
the simplest means for obtaining harmonious
tones testifies to their penetration into the secrets
of the theory of sound.</p>
<p>As appeals however to the sense of sound, the
great festivals of the Bongo abound with measures
much more thrilling than any of these minor
performances. On these occasions the orchestral
results might perhaps be fairly characterised as
cats&rsquo; music run wild.</p>
<p>Unwearied thumping of drums, the bellowings
of gigantic trumpets, for the manufacture of
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
which, great stems of trees come into requisition.
Interchanged by fits and starts with the shriller
blasts of some smaller horns, make up the burden
of the unearthly hub-bub which re-echoes miles
away along the desert; meanwhile women and
children by the hundred fill gourd flasks with little
stones, and rattle them as if they were churning
butter; or again at other times they will get some
sticks or faggots and strike them together with
the greatest energy.</p>
<p>The huge wooden tubes which may be styled
the trumpets of the Bongo, are by the natives
themselves, called &ldquo;manyinyee;&rdquo; they vary from
four to five feet in length, being closed at the
extremity and ornamented with carved work
representing a man&rsquo;s head, which not unfrequently
is adorned with a pair of horns. The other
end of the stem is open, and in an upper department,
towards the figure of the head, is the orifice
into which the performer blows with all his might.</p>
<p>There is another form of manyinyee, which is
made like a huge wine bottle; in order to play
upon it, the musician takes it between his knees
like a violincello, and when the build of the
instrument is too cumbrous he has to bend over
it as it lies upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little difference can be noticed between the
kettle drums of the Bongo, and those of most
other North African Negroes. A section is cut
from the thick stem of a tree, the preference
being given to a tamarind when it can be procured,
this is hollowed out into a cylinder, one end being
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
larger than the other. The ends are then covered
with two pieces of goat skin, stripped of the hair
which are tightly strained, and laced together
with thongs.</p>
<p>At the nightly orgies a fire is invariably kept
burning to dry the skin, and to tighten it, when it
has happened to become relaxed by the heavy
dews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short description of the signal horns of the
Bongo is also given by our musical traveller;
some of them resemble fifes, and many are made
of antelope horns.</p>
<p>Regarding the singing of the Bongo, Schweinfurth
is quite descriptive and as the deductions he
arrives at are very similar to those we have
ascribed to primitive or natural men, we introduce
the passage without alteration.<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Difficult were the task to give any adequate
description of the singing of the Bongo. It must
suffice to say that it consists of a babbling recitative,
which at one time suggests the yelling of a
dog, and at another the lowing of a cow, whilst it
is broken over, and again by the gabbling of
a string of words which are huddled up one into
another. The commencement of a measure will
always be with a lively air, and every one without
distinction of age or sex will begin yelling,
screeching, and bellowing with all their strength;
gradually the surging of voices will tone down,
the rapid time will moderate, and the song be
hushed into a wailing melancholy strain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thus it sinks into a very dirge such as might be
chanted at the grave, and be interpreted as
representative of a leaden and a frowning sky,
when all at once, without note of warning, there
bursts forth the whole fury of the negro throats;
shrill and thrilling is the outcry, and the contrast
is as vivid as sunshine in the midst of rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often as I was present at these festivities I
never could prevent my ideas from associating
Bongo music with the instinct of imitation which
belongs to men universally. The orgies always
gave me the impression of having no other object
than to surpass in violence the fury of the
elements: adequately to represent the rage of a
hurricane in the tropics, any single instrument
must of course be weak, poor, and powerless,
consequently they hammer at numbers of their
gigantic drums with powerful blows of their heavy
clubs. If they would rival the bursting of a
storm, the roaring of the wind, or the plashing of
the rain, they summon a chorus of their stoutest
lungs; whilst to depict the bellowing of terrified
wild beasts, they resort to their longest horns; and
to imitate the songs of birds, they bring together
all their flutes and fifes.</p>
<p>Most characteristic of all, perchance is the deep
and rolling bass of the huge &lsquo;manyinyee&rsquo; as
descriptive of the rumbling thunder. The penetrating
shower may drive rattling and crackling
among the twigs and amid the parched foliage of
the woods; and this is imitated by the united
energies of women and children, as they rattle the
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
stones in their gourd-flasks, and clash together
their bits of wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dances of these people are similar in wildness
to their music. The performers wear iron
rings, with balls attached, around their ankles,
and clash these together with such energy that
their feet are often bathed in blood.</p>
<p>The Mittoo tribe rank very high among the
African tribes, in their musical attainments; their
melodies are quite agreeable to the cultivated ear
and the pains which they take in mastering the
intricacies of a musical composition, recall to the
mind the difficulties which beset the path of the
civilized musical student.</p>
<p>We have seen a transcription of one of their
songs, which would require but little alteration to
transform it into a very fair &ldquo;slumber song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of them are quite skillful upon the flute,
and have been described by Nubian travellers as
equal to the best Frankish (European) performers
who reside in Cairo.</p>
<p>The Monbuttoo also have a strong passion for
music, so much so that the king sometimes dances
before his wives and subjects, to the accompaniment
of the royal band.</p>
<p>In his court concerts he has horn-men, who can
modulate their tones from infinite tenderness to
the sound of a lion&rsquo;s roar; and can perform upon
a horn so cumbrous that it can scarcely be held,
passages of runs, trills and shakes, which would
be even difficult upon a flute.</p>
<p>Court fools, jesters and mimics also appertain
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
to the King of the Monbuttoo&mdash;Munza; they have
also a sort of national hymn, more noisy than
musical. The words are monotonous and much
repeated,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ee, ee, tchupy, tchupy, ee, Munza, ee!&rdquo; will
do as a sample line. The king stands up and <i>beats
time</i>, with all the gravity of a musical conductor.
His <i>baton</i> is made of a wicker worked sphere filled
with pebbles, and attached to a short stick, in fact
exactly what we should call a baby&rsquo;s rattle.
When he approves the performance or gets
excited, he joins in the chorus with a stentorian
&ldquo;B-r-r-r-r&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; which shakes the house.</p>
<p>It is singular that music boxes should be popular
with Africans who indulge in such noisy
effects, yet such is the fact; there is no present so
desired by Negro potentates as a music box with
bells and drums.</p>
<p>Explorers can find no surer road to the heart of
an African chief than by a present of one of
these mechanisms. Sir Samuel Baker had great
trouble with King Kabba Rega (of the tribe of
the Unyori,) about a music box.<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a> Speke and
Schweinfurth both found them among the most
treasured possessions of the savage chieftains.
Kabba Rega&rsquo;s reason for prizing the box above all
other musical instruments, is unique; on hearing it
play, for the first time, he remarked,&mdash;&ldquo;It is more
convenient than an instrument which requires
study, as you might set this going at night, to
play you to sleep, when you were too drunk to
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
play it yourself even if you knew how to do it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a>
The national hymn of this monarch, bears
considerable resemblance to the first part of the
well known air&mdash;&ldquo;Three Blind Mice.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a></p>
<p>We have not space to describe fully the rites
and music of that curious people, the Abyssinians;
two examples of their musical ceremonies must
suffice.</p>
<p>A funeral procession (reported by an American
eye witness) consisted of about one hundred and
fifty people, old and young, preceded by a few
priests; every few minutes the <i>cortege</i> would halt
to shriek and howl. The priests (clad in cotton
robes with broad scarlet bands) were acting in a
frantic manner; tearing off their turbans, pulling
their hair, then folding their hands on their
breasts and looking inexpressibly miserable.</p>
<p>They carried Arabic parchment books, illuminated
with quaint figures and devices, and now and
then chanted prayers to some favorite saint,<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a> very
dolefully, though with strong lungs and nasal
intonation. Numerous genuflections were made,
always accompanied with long drawn howls of
extreme agony. At the lowering of the body
into the grave, they chanted a prayer, of which
the following is a translation,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Werkena, son of Yasous, who was the son of
Tekee, is dead. Rejoice, oh ye people! He has
gone to his rest with Abraham, with Isaac, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
with Jacob. Let us pray for those who still live,
and pray for the soul just gone to doom. From
vengeance and stern judgment, pray that his soul
be delivered. How can the souls be delivered
from tribulation? By long prayers. Pray, then,
that he be sheltered by Father Abraham, that he
may walk in safety by the side of Moses and the
prophets, Amen, and Amen!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a></p>
<p>After the grave was closed, the major part of
the mourners followed in the train of a musician,
who was discoursing lively tunes on an oboe, and
one of the priests, who had been mourning so
vigorously, offered to show strangers over his
cathedral for the consideration of one dollar.</p>
<p>A fitting contrast to this, is the musical ovation
tendered to the British Army, after the conquest
of King Theodore, April, 1868. The natives came
in great numbers to sing praises. They chose
for the subject of their psalm, the twenty-second
chapter, of the second book of Samuel, (David&rsquo;s
song), beginning:&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord is my rock, and
my fortress,&rdquo; and they sang it with David&rsquo;s own
fervor; and, to make it quite realistic, in imitation
of his dancing before the ark, the Abyssinian
clergy brought out an imitation of an ark, five
yards in length, one yard in breadth, and a foot in
height. It was covered with a scarlet cloth,
embroidered with gold, and above it was a
representation of a mercy-seat of crimson silk,
surmounted by a canopy of similar stuff; candlesticks,
lavers, priests&rsquo; robes, hyssops, communion
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
cups, pixes, chalices, crosses of brass, silver and
gold, mitres, etc., figured in the religious paraphernalia
employed. The Neophytes kept up a
deafening, jingling clang; or, with instruments
of wood and brass, one stringed banjoes, clanking
brass cymbals kept a rhythmic time, which swelled
louder and louder as they drew near the headquarters
of the army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priests (out of respect for their office)
took the front position, and one of them, with a
semi-ludicrous air, struck up the first note of the
impromptu stanzas which were to celebrate the
British conquest of Abyssinia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he warmed to his theme, and his voice
rose to enthusiasm, the motley assembly, at the
waving of a crucifix, chimed in with chorus, which,
sung with stentorian lungs, had a tremendous
effect. After the chorus, six priests clad in cotton
stoles headed by the sub-hierarch, took the eulogy
up at a very low key, which soon, however, rose
so high and shrill in a protracted continuity of
sound, that one momentarily expected to hear
their lungs crack, ending with a stormy chorus as
before. Then, forming themselves into a circle,
a hundred of them commenced a dignified sailing
round their neighbors, to the right and left, their
togas getting inflated with the movement, weaving
each into another, until it might have been
imagined that they had manufactured some
complicated knot, on the gordian principle; but,
soon taking the reverse method, they reached
their former positions in time. The singing went
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
on louder and louder, and the choragus giving the
warning clap, the whole multitude clapped their
hands; the women and children struck up the
silver-toned &lsquo;li, li, li,&rsquo; performing a dance
similar to the Chinese hop and skip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They then formed triplets and massed themselves
together, when a shrill note from the boys,
sent them into a confused whirl, round and round,
the sub-hierarch and his six assistants going
faster and faster, as they acquired momentum,
clapping their hands, singing louder than ever,
the head priest ducking his body lower and lower,
and more energetic, until the dance and the
excitement which they all labored under, assumed
the appearance of a jubilee medley, composed of
waltzes, Dervish-dances, sarabands, fandangos,
pirouettes and chasses, the three latter performed
by the most youthful of the assembly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must not be forgotten, that all this time the
ark and mercy-seat&mdash;minus the cherubim&mdash;(which
was totally omitted from this Abyssinian
imitation), stood on the ground near the priests,
while a choice number of infantine neophites,
manfully rang the merriest chimes, and the
instruments of Juniper-wood, the one-stringed
banjos, and cymbals, made as much discordant
music as was possible under the circumstances.
The Ethiops before concluding the entertainment,
raised<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a> once again the Canto Trionfale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect Mr. Stanley says, had a wonderful
charm, and the blending of the mass of women&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
and children&rsquo;s voices with the larger and deeper
tones of the bass, was like the whistling of a
gale in a ship&rsquo;s shrouds, blending with the deeper
roar of a tempest.</p>
<p>We cannot give a better idea of the hold which
music has upon the average native Negro, than
by narrating an incident which befell Sir Samuel
Baker, in the Shooli country.</p>
<p>He held a review of his troops March 8, 1872,
and after a sham fight, firing of rockets, etc., the
troops marched up and down a hill, with the band
playing. The natives assembled in considerable
numbers and viewed the man&oelig;uvres with much
delight; but the brass band music was the crowning
point of their enjoyment. We sub-join his
description of its effect upon these children of
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music of our band being produced simply
by a considerable number of bugles, drums, and
cymbals, aided by a large military bass-drum,
might not have been thought first-rate in Europe,
but in Africa it was irresistible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives are passionately fond of music;
and I believe the safest way to travel in these
wild countries, would be to play the cornet, if
possible, without ceasing, which would ensure a
safe passage. A London organ-grinder would
march through Central Africa, followed by an
admiring and enthusiastic crowd, who, if his
tunes were lively, would form a dancing escort of
the most untiring material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As my troops returned to their quarters, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
the band playing rather lively airs, we observed
the women racing down from their villages, and
gathering from all directions towards the common
centre. As they approached nearer, the charms
of music were overpowering, and halting for an
instant they assumed what they considered the
most graceful attitudes, and then danced up to
band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a short time my buglers could scarcely
blow their instruments for laughing at the extraordinary
effect of their performance. A fantastic
crowd surrounded them as they halted in our
position among the rocks, and every minute
added to their number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women throughout the Shooli are entirely naked;
thus the effect of a female crowd,
bounding madly about as musical enthusiasts,
was very extraordinary; even the babies were
brought out to dance; and these infants strapped
to their mothers&rsquo; backs, and covered with pumpkin
shells, like the young tortoises, were jolted
about, without the slightest consideration for the
weakness of their necks, by their infatuated
mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As usual among all tribes of Central Africa,
the old women were even more determined
dancers than the young girls. Several old
Venuses were making themselves extremely ridiculous,
as they sometimes do in civilized countries,
when attempting the allurements of younger
days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;The men did not share in the dance, but
squatted upon the rocks in great numbers to
admire the music and to witness the efforts of
their wives and daughters.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a></p>
<p>Sir Samuel Baker also once used music for
quite a different purpose. He was quartered near
the town of Masindi, where dwelt Kabba Rega,
King of the Unyori, when one evening, he
noticed a most unusual stillness in the town,
where ordinarily drunken songs and horn-blowing
were the rule. Suddenly there sounded the deep
tones of a <i>nogara</i>, or drum. This ceased in a
moment; and then came a burst of terrific noise,
which caused every man in camp to rush to his
post. It was a din, caused by many thousands
yelling and shrieking like maniacs. At least a
thousand drums were beating; horns, whistles,
and every instrument which could add to the
confusion, was blowing and sounding, yet no
human being was visible.</p>
<p>The dragoman, on being questioned by the
commander, laughed, and said it was &ldquo;to make
him <i>afraid</i>, and exhibit the large number of people
collected in the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gen. Baker on ascertaining this determined to
act as though it were a compliment which he felt
bound to return. He ordered the regimental
band to strike up, and play their loudest. This
nonchalance had its effect, for, after a short time,
the bugles, drums, and clashing cymbals of his
own band, were the only sounds heard; the
tumult in Masindi had subsided, and soon Gen.
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
Baker ordered his own musicians to cease playing,
and all was again perfectly still.<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a></p>
<p>We close this account of the music of some of
the savage tribes of the earth, with a description
of a farewell dance, given to Stanley, by the
Wanyamwezi of Singiri, which is well worthy of
a place, as showing the powers of improvisation
of the Africans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a wild dance, with lively music, four
drums giving the sonorous accompaniment, being
beaten with tremendous energy and strength.
Everyone (even Stanley himself) danced with
great fervor, and combined excited gesticulations,
with their saltatory efforts. But after the close of
this war-like music, came a total change; all
dropped on their knees, and in sorrowful accents
sang a slow and solemn refrain, of which the
following is a literal translation,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Solo</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, oh, oh! the white man is going home.</p>

<p>It is curious to contrast this quiet and pathetic

<br />MUSIC OF THE EARLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH.</h2>
<p>We now resume the chronological chain of
musical history, from the termination of &ldquo;Ancient
Greek music;&rdquo; for the music of the Christian
church took its rise, from the melodies of Ancient
Greece. Yet it is probable that the earliest
Christian melodies were not according to the
classical Grecian type, but rather conformed to
the popular in style. This has always been the
case in the rise of a new sect with sagacious
leaders. The Jews on leaving Egypt, yet sang
the popular melodies dear to their hearts, by
association of childhood and youth; only at a later
period, only when these songs were no longer
so endeared to them did David introduce such
reforms, as gave to the Hebrew music a distinctive
style. So, also, it was with the Christian
church in its earliest days; it would have been
positively injudicious, at first, to have attempted a
reform; and therefore, the old popular melodies
of Greece and Rome, were set to new words and
exerted a new influence.</p>
<p>Music has been, with every religion, the most
powerful accessory of the Faith; but with none
more than with Christianity. It had the additional
advantage, of being in an advancing state
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
(under the charge of able directors, who fully saw
the power of the art when made popular) while
the music of the Pagan church was greatly declining.
The great emperor Julian, foresaw the
result, and used great efforts to secure a better
class of music for the Roman sacrifices, but without
avail.</p>
<p>With regard to the Christian music of the time
of the apostles, we have only tradition, but these
traditions have so much probability, that they
acquire some degree of authority.</p>
<p>Eusebius assures us that St. Mark taught the
first Egyptian Christians how to chant their
prayers: St. John Chrysostom affirms (in his
sixth homily) that the Apostles wrote the first
hymn. In Rome (according to Tertullian) the
chants were given in a deep tone, and not in a
sustained manner, at one part of the service, and
with strong accents, and flexible voice at another.
The Fathers of the church almost all bear testimony
that the music of the service generally
partook of the habitual style of singing of each
nation.</p>
<p>Kiesewetter, one of the most careful of the
students of Ancient Greek music, maintains that,
while the early Christians borrowed much from
Greece, yet from the first, the tendency was
rather away from, than in the path of the Greek
style. Brendel in his essays coincides with this
opinion.<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a></p>
<p>The cause of this, so far as Rome and Greece
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
are concerned, is very apparent. The apostles
and their followers, started unencumbered in the
musical field. The theory of Greek music was a
most difficult one to master, and the converts were
at first almost wholly among the humbler classes.
It would have been impossible to have trained
them in the elaborate Hellenic school, therefore,
the more ear-catching melodies were at first used,
combined probably with a simple chant. The
same cause operated in the foundation of a newer
and simpler theory of music; hence, although our
modern music is the child of the ancient Greek
school, yet it did not go in the same course, or
arrive at the same goal which would have resulted,
had the old Greek civilization been continued two
thousand years longer.</p>
<p>We hold that the Greeks were too much devoted
to the plastic arts, ever to have brought music
deeply into the inner life.</p>
<p>Before the liturgy had been well established,
improvisation was much employed; a result always
to be anticipated when uncultivated persons
become musical. At the evening meal, the twenty-third
Psalm was usually chanted.<a class="fn" id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a> Other
passages of scripture were also used, such as
Exodus <span class="smaller">XV.</span>, and Daniel <span class="smaller">III.</span></p>
<p>When the water was passed around for the
washing of hands, each one of the company was
asked in turn to praise God in song, and the selection
might either be taken from Scripture, or
improvised, according to the taste or ability of
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
the performer.<a class="fn" id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a> Some of the best of these
effusions were unquestionably preserved and possibly
even admitted into the regular service of the
church. The songs may have been rough and
uncouth, but they were given with a fervor which
compensated for any short-comings. They were
unaccompanied, for two reasons; first, it would
have been difficult to have formed an instrumental
accompaniment to such variable and primitive
songs, (sometimes a mere intonation of the voice,
scarcely to be called music or even chanting); and
second, because all the instruments of the heathen
were in daily use at the sacrifices and theatres;
and it would have seemed sacrilegious to have
used them in the celebration of a Christian festival.<a class="fn" id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a></p>
<p>The summing up of the legends, surmises, and
few statements concerning the music of the earliest
Christians, are well expressed in Ambros.<a class="fn" id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a></p>
<p>We can conclude regarding the music of the
earliest Christian times, that it was at first a
species of Folk-song, founded upon the school of
music then in vogue, but elevated and impregnated
with a new religious spirit. But this simplicity
soon was changed: profiting by the experience
of the Romans in uniting all art and beauty in
their theatres, (whereby the theatre grew, and the
church declined;) the early Christians soon found
it wise to unite every art, in the service of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
church. It is also probable that much of the
music was borrowed from that of the Hebrews.
This is more natural when we reflect that Christianity
was at first a continuation (or reorganization)
of Hebrew rites and the apostles were all well
acquainted with the ceremonies of the Jewish
church.</p>
<p>The chanting of the scriptures which took
place in the latter worship, was undoubtedly
transplanted into the Christian service.<a class="fn" id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a> Many of
the early psalms and canticles were sung in caves
and subterranean retreats in which places the
proscribed and persecuted worshippers were
obliged to seek refuge, and where they still kept,
up with undeviating regularity the practice of
their ceremonies.</p>
<p>Pliny the younger on being made pro-consul of
Bithynia was especially charged by the emperor
Trajan, to find accusations against the Christians
there, the number of whom was augmenting daily.
A letter of his, supposed to have been written in
the third year of the second century of our era,<a class="fn" id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a>
contains the following regarding the new religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They affirm that their fault, and errors have
only consisted of this;&mdash;they convene at stated
days, before sunrise, and sing, each in turn, verses
in praise of Christ, as of a God; they engage
themselves, by oath, not to do any crime, but
never to commit theft, robbery, or adultery, never
to break faith, or betray a trust. After this they
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
separate and afterwards reassemble to eat together
innocent and innocuous dishes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a></p>
<p>At a later period (the fourth century) all proselytes
and new converts were not admitted to sing
in the church with the baptized. The new converts
presented themselves before the hierarch, (a
dignitary who was charged with the duty of classifying
the catechumens in different orders) and
expressed to him the desire of joining the church.
If the questions of the priests were satisfactorily
answered, he placed his hand on the head of the
applicant and gave him the benediction with the
sign of the cross, and afterwards inscribed his
name among the number of candidates for baptism.
The catechumen had not the right to enter
the church. He might linger around the porticos,
but was on no account allowed to join in the
prayers, except in a low voice, and in the hymns
not at all, until he had received the rite of baptism.</p>
<p>The candidates for baptism were divided into
various classes. Even after baptism there were
three orders of Christians, and those who had
fallen into disgrace with the church, were sometimes
disciplined by being reduced for a few years
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
to the rank of auditors at the services. These were
not allowed to join in the congregational singing,
and were sometimes not even admitted to the body
of the church edifice unless called there.</p>
<p>It is presumable that the right to join in the
singing was, during the first two or three centuries,
highly prized.</p>
<p>Little by little the spirit of improvement crept
into the unskilled but soul-felt music of the early
Christian church. It seems rather strange to find
in the very germs of the religion, a silent, yet real
contest between congregational and paid singing;
and to find the same evils creeping in with the
employment of singers in those early times, that
we see in the present days of quartette choirs. In
the days of Origen (about the middle of the
second century) all the congregation sang together.</p>
<p>St. John Chrysostom says,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The psalms which we sing united all the voices
in one, and the canticles arise harmoniously in
unison. Young and old, rich and poor, women,
men, slaves and citizens, all of us have formed
but one melody together.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a></p>
<p>A better picture of the full congregational
singing of the primitive Christians cannot be
given. The custom of allowing both sexes to
sing together, was abolished by the Synod of
Antioch in <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 379, and it was then decided that
the men only should be allowed to sing the psalms.</p>
<p>In <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 481, the council of Laodicea ordained
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
that the clerks only (called canonical singers
&ldquo;<i>Canonicos Cantores</i>,&rdquo;) should be allowed to sing
during the service.<a class="fn" id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a> The abuses which accompany
paid singing, appeared even in the second century.
Singers found themselves sought after in proportion
to their talents, and therefore (in the absence
of an exact method of notation) sought to make
those talents more conspicuous by an introduction
of florid ornaments and cadenzas into their music;
they gradually forgot, or disregarded the old
traditional style of singing, and sought only to
excite the admiration of the masses by exhibiting
to the best advantage the power and agility of
their voices.</p>
<p>It was, without doubt, to remedy this abuse
that Pope Sylvester <span class="smaller">I</span>, who occupied the pontifical
chair, <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 320, founded a school in Rome for
the formation of singers.<a class="fn" id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a> At this time also, the
choir had its own gallery or place in the church
assigned to it, and every art was called into play
to impress and enthrall the worshipper. Sculpture,
Painting, Architecture and Music combined,
as they had previously done for Pagan theatres
and amusements, to render the church a beautiful
as well as holy resort. Charity combined in some
instances with policy; for we learn that a singing
school founded in <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 350, by pope Hilary, was
called an orphan asylum (orphanotrophia), and
here the education of clerks for the church, was
commenced at a very tender age.<a class="fn" id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>These schools did much to re-establish a dignified
and worthy style of sacred singing. Yet
there was great need of a sweeping reform; for as
there existed no really fixed system, the differences
in singing were almost as numerous as the various
existing churches. Before speaking of this reform,
we will briefly outline the progress of music
in Christian communities outside of Rome.</p>
<h3 id="c32">GREEK CHURCH.</h3>
<p>The Greek church, from the very beginning,
paid great attention to music in all its details.
The first institution of the mass, is attributed to
St. James the lesser, first bishop of Jerusalem,
who died a martyr in <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 62. This mass is still
in existence. There are also existing, masses by
the two great luminaries of the Greek Church,
Sts. John Chrysostom and Basilius, who flourished
in the last half of the fourth century.</p>
<p>Although there are doubts expressed as to
whether St. John Chrysostom wrote the one
attributed to him, yet it is certain that the mass
was used in Constantinople (of which city he was
the Patriarch) as long ago as the end of the fourth
century, and was not materially changed until the
eighth century. It is entitled &ldquo;The mystery of
the divine Eucharist.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a></p>
<p>The <i>hymns</i>, which at first were not used at all in
the Roman church, were one of the brightest
ornaments of the Greek. The verses and ancient
tunes of these hymns were at first well adapted to
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
each other; but, by the constant introduction of
embellishments, shakes, and cadenzas, the connection
was soon lost.</p>
<p>This taste for ornamentation in sacred music
was driven to far greater excess in the Greek
church, than even in Rome; the taste <i>fioritura</i>
is to-day, and always has been, a characteristic of
most Eastern nations. This is driven to such
excess in the Greek church, that (in the churches
of the Orient, at least), the hymns are executed
by two singers, one of whom sings the hymns,
while the other sustains the key note or principal
tone only.</p>
<p>This note the singer gives out with regularity
and monotony, its only object being to keep the
principal singer in bounds and to prevent him
from straying away from the key on account of
the numerous trills and <i>fiorituri</i> which he is
expected to introduce into the song.</p>
<p>It may be well to mention here, as we shall not
recur to the music of the Eastern Greek church
again, that its style of notation, and singing has
altered very little, in the course of centuries; it is
totally different from that of all other countries,
and consists wholly of signs, which are not in any
manner measured off into bars, but somewhat
resemble the chants of the Catholic church. The
notes are only relative in value, and the scale on
which the melodies are founded, may be represented
thus,&mdash;</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="c">Re, </td><td class="c">Mi, </td><td class="c">Fa, </td><td class="c">Sol, </td><td class="c">La, </td><td class="c">Si, </td><td class="c">Do, </td><td class="c">Re.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c">Pa, </td><td class="c">Bou, </td><td class="c">Ga, </td><td class="c">Di, </td><td class="c">Ke, </td><td class="c">Z&ocirc;, </td><td class="c">Ne, </td><td class="c">Pa.</td></tr>
</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>Every embellishment is represented by a character;
rising and falling inflections by others, and
comparative length of notes by yet others.</p>
<p>It will therefore be seen that although the
notation is decidedly complicated, there is a comprehensible
system followed, by consulting which,
we attain certain information as to one branch of
the early church.<a class="fn" id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a></p>
<p>The works found in the old monasteries of the
Orient are almost invaluable to the musical antiquary.
We believe that many more will yet be
discovered among the monks of Mt. Athos, those
strange and illiterate custodians of some of the
rarest manuscripts in existence, relative to this
subject.<a class="fn" id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a></p>
<p>We are sorry that a thorough description of
this subject (though full of interest) would demand
much space and many engravings. The effect of
the singing of this church in its oriental branches
is very similar to that of the Hebrews in their
services of the present day.</p>
<h3 id="c33">SYRIAN CHURCH.</h3>
<p>We now turn to the early Christian church of
Syria, founded by the Apostles Paul and Barnabas.</p>
<p>One of the earliest in existence, the church of
Antioch soon became the metropolis of Syrian
Christianity. Yet it was in this church also that
the first heresy took place, by the rise of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
Gnostics (disciples of science); one of this sect,
named Bardesanes, founded a separate denomination
of these, and was the first who composed
hymns in the native tongue, and adapted them to
melodies. He composed one hundred and fifty
psalms in imitation of David.</p>
<p>But greatest of all the musicians of the Orthodox
Christian church of Syria, was Ephraem
Syrus. He is still called &ldquo;Harp of the Holy
Spirit&rdquo; in many churches who yet honor him
and celebrate his feast.</p>
<p>He was a monk of Syria, born of poor parents,
in a village of Mesopotamia. At eighteen years
of age he was converted and baptized, and soon
retired to a desert spot to practice penitence and
piety. It was in this retreat that he composed his
voluminous sermons, hymns, etc., all of which
have much poetic beauty and oriental imagery.<a class="fn" id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a>
He wrote fifteen hymns on the &ldquo;Nativity,&rdquo;
fifteen on &ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo; fifty-two on &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Church,&rdquo; fifty-one on &ldquo;The Virginity,&rdquo;
eighty-seven against &ldquo;Heresy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Arians,&rdquo; eighty-five &ldquo;Mortuary,&rdquo; fifteen moral
hymns, etc. His writings on the <i>Peshito</i> or Syriac
version of the scriptures are still of use to the
theological student.</p>
<p>He arranged the music to his hymns, and he
himself speaks of having arranged sixty-six of
them in the style of Bardesanes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>Many of the songs and prayers in the Syrian
liturgy, ascribed to St. Ephraem are spurious. It
is related that at the first interview between him
and St. Basilius, the former was endowed by the
Holy Ghost with sudden power to speak Greek,
and the latter Syriac, thus giving them a choice
of languages in which to converse.</p>
<p>It is impossible to give a thorough account of
the music of the Syrian Church, as although the
first instruments mentioned in the Bible (the taboret,
a tambourine held in one hand and struck
with the other, and Kinnor, a seven stringed
triangular harp) are Syrian, yet the people have
never, from time immemorial, written down their
melodies, but always handed them down orally,
father to son, or teacher to pupil.</p>
<p>The mass in Syrian liturgy, is very different in
its form, from the Catholic: there is neither <i>Kyrie
Eleison</i>, <i>Gloria</i>, nor <i>Epistle</i>, contained in it.</p>
<p>There are two distinct sects in the Syrian
church; the first Ephraemitic, or followers of the
Orthodox saint; the second, heretical and followers
of Jacob Baradaeus, a Syrian monk of the
sixth century. These are called Jacobites, and
hold Eutychian doctrines.</p>
<p>The music of the latter is ornamented to excess;
that of the Ephraemitic rite nobler and plainer.</p>
<h3 id="c34">THE ARMENIAN CHURCH.</h3>
<p>The rise of Christianity among the Armenians,
goes back to the third century, but they early
developed the doctrines of Eutychius, and the
Monophysites. At times, portions of the Armenian
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
church have adhered to the Western church,
but in its rites it far more resembles the Eastern
Greek church. The language is well adapted for
song.</p>
<p>Their most ancient religious songs were written
by <i>Sahac</i>, the great <i>Katholicos</i>, or patriarch of the
church; the psalms were sung by them to popular
melodies.</p>
<h3 id="c35">THE CHURCHES OF AFRICA.</h3>
<p>St. Mark is considered as the Apostle of Egypt
and founder of the church of Alexandria; the
liturgy used by this church is said to have been
written by him; but many manuscripts exist
which point to St. Basilius as its author, and it
bears internal evidence that St. Mark could not
have written it, for among the prayers for the
dead, it names many saints, martyrs, bishops, etc.,
<i>including St. Mark</i>.</p>
<p>The songs of the early Christians here, as
throughout the Orient, were hymns, psalms, and
anthems of which the melodies were taken from
the popular music of the day.</p>
<p>The Coptic church in its liturgy entirely resembled
the Greek church of Egypt, and in looking
over its ritual, one continually meets with translations
of the liturgies of St. Basil, St. Cyrille, or
St. Gregory Nazianzen. In the National Library,
of Paris there is also a Coptic translation of the
Liturgy of St. Mark.</p>
<p>The music of the Coptic church is very much
embellished, and of inordinate length; for, owing
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
to the practice of the singers to vocalise upon one
syllable sometimes to the length of <i>several minutes</i><a class="fn" id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a>
the vespers alone, often attain the length of
<i>four or five hours</i>.</p>
<p>As the rules of worship of the Copts do not
allow them either to kneel or to sit down during
services, they are obliged to support themselves
by placing under their arm-pits, a long crutch, in
order not to drop from fatigue.</p>
<p>This race is degenerating fast, and will soon
disappear under the despotic sway of the Arabs.
Their number is about one hundred and fifty
thousand. Few of them understand the Coptic
language, and although part of the service is sung
in that tongue, it is usually afterwards explained
in Arabic. Their modulations in singing are very
bold, constant, and fatiguing; so much so, that
long before the end of the song, all remembrance
of any key-note, is lost.</p>
<p>All writers agree in speaking of their music, as
tiresome in the extreme. This proceeds from
three causes;&mdash;their extraordinary length, their
insignificant melody, and the constant repetition
of the syllables and vowels of a single word, whereby
it is made almost impossible to follow the sense
of the text. This fault is not confined to the
Coptic sect only, but is largely found in the Greek
church throughout the Orient. Fetis gives a
strong example of one case, taken from an
Eastern Hymnal, it runs as follows,&mdash;</p>
<p>Aga-a-a-a-a-a-aate-e-e-e-e mara ky-y-y-ri-i-i-i-i-ou.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>Each of the vowels is given separate from
the others, and the effect is ludicrous in the
extreme. The Copts do worse than this; after
mincing a word into such minute fragments,
they go back and re-mutilate the first syllable,
then again the second, then perhaps the first two,
and so on for a long time before they give the
word complete like the Syrians.</p>
<p>The Copts have no musical notation whatever,
and it is a most curious fact in music, that they
should be able to recollect such lengthy songs,
devoid of any apparent melody, or sequence,
and hand them down traditionally, from generation
to generation; they must possess either
phenomenal memories, or an insight to a connection
of ideas in their songs, which has escaped
European perception. These remarkable descendants
of the ancient Egyptians, hate other Christian
sects with much more fervor than they do the
Mohammedans.</p>
<p>Of the Abyssinian Church we have already
spoken, (see chapters on &ldquo;African Music&rdquo;);&mdash;there
is little more to add. They have different
modes of singing for different grades of sacred
festivals. Responses made by the people or the
choir, enter largely into their mass. The number
of choristers is from eight to twelve, and they
have all powerful voices; this is in fact a prime
necessity, as at the door of the church, during
service, a constant din of drums, cymbals, and
sistrums is kept up.</p>
<p>On certain days, the priests and people have a
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
grand religious dance, to the sound of these
instruments, while the chorus sing a litany and
all mark the time by a clapping of hands.</p>
<h3 id="c36">GENERAL SYNOPSIS OF EARLY CHRISTIAN MUSIC.</h3>
<p>That the art of music was esteemed among the
more educated of the early Christians is very
strongly shown by a fresco in the cemetery of
Domitilla (in Rome). This painting which seems
to be of the first or second century of our era,
represents Christ as Orpheus, charming all nature
by his music.<a class="fn" id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a> It is probably only an allegorical
figure, representing his divine gifts, but the figure
must be a shock to all who are accustomed to see
the face of Jesus, as drawn by the Leonardo da
Vinci. Instead of the meek and beautiful form,
we see here a lank loosely-built young man, sitting
in a very uncomfortable attitude, on a rock, and
twanging away at a four-stringed lyre.</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the present pictures of
Christ (although not strictly belonging to our
subject) we are tempted to make the following
remarks.</p>
<p>It is believed by some scholars that the head of
Christ was first copied from the statue of Jupiter
(or the Greek Zeus), which was, in the early
centuries regarded as the most perfect model of
manly beauty. It is scarcely to be doubted that
the general model of the Pagan sculptures was
followed in the early representations of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
Saviour. But the style of portraits was altered in
consonance with the description handed down by
good authorities.</p>
<p>A brass medal with a head of Christ on one
side, was discovered in 1702, in some Druidical
ruins, at Aberfraw, Wales, which although of a
later era than that assigned to it, is of great
antiquity, and coincides with the pictures of
to-day.</p>
<p>There exists a letter ascribed to Publius Lentulus
and directed to the emperor Tiberius, which
describes Jesus. Although it is apocryphal, yet it
was certainly written in the days of the primitive
Christians. It is translated as follows,&mdash;<a class="fn" id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;There hath appeared in these, our days, a
man of great virtue, named Jesus Christ, who is
yet living among us, and of the Gentiles, is
accepted as a prophet, but his disciples call him
the Son of God. He raiseth the dead, and cures
all manner of diseases; a man of stature somewhat
tall and comely, with very reverend countenance,
such as the beholders both love and fear;
his hair the color of chestnut, full ripe, plain to
his ears, whence downward it is more orient,
curling and waving about his shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the midst of his head is a seam or partition
of the hair, after the manner of the Nazarites;
his forehead plain and very delicate; his face
without a spot or wrinkle, beautified with the
most lovely red; his nose and mouth so formed
that nothing can be reprehended; his beard
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
thickish, in color like his hair, not very long but
forked; his look innocent and mature, his eyes
gray, clear, and quick. In reproving he is terrible;
in admonishing, courteous and fair spoken; pleasant
in conversation mixed with gravity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be remarked that any one saw him
laugh, but many have seen him weep. In proportion
of body, most excellent; his hands and arms
most delicate to behold. In speaking, very temperate,
moderate and wise. A man for his singular
beauty, surpassing the children of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this letter of the predecessor of Pontius
Pilate (?) the two earliest known portraits of
Christ (in the Calixtine and Pontine catacombs
at Rome) were probably sketched and the model
has been followed up to our day.</p>
<p>But there is another description, by St. John of
Damascus, which is much more in keeping with
the Jewish type, of which he supposes the Saviour
probably may have had some trait.</p>
<p>According to him, Christ had beautiful eyes,
but the eyebrows meeting; a regular nose, flowing
locks, a black beard, and a straw colored
complexion, like his mother.</p>

<br />THE AMBROSIAN AND GREGORIAN CHANT.</h2>
<p>St Ambrose, the first real reformer in the music
of the Christian Church, was born <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 333,
probably at Treves, where his father who was
prefect of Gaul, often resided. He is said to
have received an auspicious omen even in his
cradle; a swarm of bees alighted upon him during
his slumber, and the astonished nurse saw that
they did not sting him, but clustered around his
lips; his father, remembering a similar wonder
related of Plato, predicted a high destiny for his
son. He was therefore, thoroughly educated in
his youth, and soon was sent with Satyrus, his
brother, to Milan to study law.</p>
<p>He soon became so eminent in this profession,
that he was appointed (<span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 369) prefect of upper
Italy and Milan. In <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 374 he was unanimously,
and against his will, chosen bishop of Milan.</p>
<p>Once in the chair, however, he ruled with vigor
and great sagacity, making numerous and necessary
reforms in church regulations and discipline.<a class="fn" id="fr_248" href="#fn_248">[248]</a></p>
<p>We shall only follow his musical career. Unfortunately,
although there are some remains in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
Milanese church-chant of to-day, we have but
little proof of the nature of his reforms. That it
was deeply impressive we have the testimony of
St. Augustine who eulogises, without accurately
describing it,<a class="fn" id="fr_249" href="#fn_249">[249]</a> but it is certain that his reforms
were founded in part upon the Greek music, and
that in the Gregorian and Ambrosian chants of
the church, we have a legitimate descendant of the
ancient Greek music. The reader must remove
one impression from his mind; the music of the
early Christians, though certainly crude, was by no
means simple; on the contrary, it contained many
flourishes and rapid embellishments, most of
which were of oriental origin. The reform was
in the nature of simplicity, and added dignity to
a service, which already, in its words, possessed
beauty and poetry.</p>
<p>He cast aside much of the cumbrous nomenclature
of the Greek modes, and retained of them
only what was beautiful and easily comprehended.
He did not aim at any sweeping reform, as is
evident from his letter to his sister St. Marcellina,
wherein he says that he is endeavoring to regulate
the mode of singing the hymns, canticles and
anthems in his own church,<a class="fn" id="fr_250" href="#fn_250">[250]</a> and St. Augustine<a class="fn" id="fr_251" href="#fn_251">[251]</a>
says that it was done after the manner of the
churches of the Orient.</p>
<p>The modes which he chose for his compositions
were the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">First mode:&mdash; </td><td class="c">D, </td><td class="c">E, F, </td><td class="c">G, </td><td class="c">A, </td><td class="c">B, C, </td><td class="c">D,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"> </td><td class="c">re </td><td class="c">mi fa </td><td class="c">sol </td><td class="c">la </td><td class="c">si do </td><td class="c">re</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Second do. </td><td class="c">E, F, </td><td class="c">G, </td><td class="c">A, </td><td class="c">B, C, </td><td class="c">D, </td><td class="c">E,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"> </td><td class="c">mi fa </td><td class="c">sol </td><td class="c">la </td><td class="c">si do </td><td class="c">re </td><td class="c">mi</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Third do. </td><td class="c">F, </td><td class="c">G, </td><td class="c">A, </td><td class="c">B, C, </td><td class="c">D, </td><td class="c">E, F,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"> </td><td class="c">fa </td><td class="c">sol </td><td class="c">la </td><td class="c">si do </td><td class="c">re </td><td class="c">mi fa</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Fourth do. </td><td class="c">G, </td><td class="c">A, </td><td class="c">B, C, </td><td class="c">D, </td><td class="c">E, F, </td><td class="c">G,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"> </td><td class="c">sol </td><td class="c">la </td><td class="c">si do </td><td class="c">re </td><td class="c">mi fa </td><td class="c">sol</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It will be seen that the semi-tones are immovable,
and therefore occur in different positions in
each mode, by the change of the key-note; being
respectively,&mdash;</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">First mode, semitones </td><td class="c">2-3, </td><td class="c">6-7</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Second &rdquo; <span class="hst">&rdquo;</span> </td><td class="c">1-2, </td><td class="c">5-6</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l">Fourth &rdquo; <span class="hst">&rdquo;</span> </td><td class="c">3-4, </td><td class="c">6-7</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It was this distinction which gave to each mode
its peculiar character.</p>
<p>Not only did St. Ambrose reinstate these
modes, but he composed many beautiful compositions
in them. Many of the so-called Ambrosian
chants and hymns, were not written by him, but
after his manner; but some ten of the ancient
hymns, including &ldquo;<i>Veni Redemptor Gentium</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Eterna Christi munera</i>,&rdquo; etc., are from his own
pen.</p>
<p>The Cathedral of Milan still uses <i>Aeterne rerum
conditor</i>; <i>Deus Creator omnium</i>; <i>Veni Redemptor
omnium</i>; <i>Splendor Patern&aelig; glori&aelig;</i>; <i>Consors
paterni luminis</i>; and <i>O Lux Beata Trinitas</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_252" href="#fn_252">[252]</a></p>
<p>Some of these are of rare beauty, and remain
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
as monuments of the cultivated taste of this
pioneer in church music. The composition of the
&ldquo;<i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>,&rdquo; has been ascribed to St.
Ambrose, and St. Augustine; but it was composed
nearly a century after their death. Among other
persons to whom this beautiful production has
been assigned, may be mentioned St. Hilary, St.
Abundius, St. Sisebut, and St. Nicat; but it may
be safely affirmed that its real author has never
been discovered.</p>
<p>The greatest boon bestowed on the church by
St. Ambrose was the rhythmical hymn, mentioned
above, all of which, and many others he wrote
for the Cathedral which he built at Milan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire accent, and style of chanting as
regulated by him, was undoubtedly an artistic
and cultivated improvement on that of preceding
church services, such as would naturally result
from the rare combination of piety, zeal, intellect,
and poetical and musical power by which he was
distinguished.&rdquo; The Ambrosian chant was eventually
merged, but certainly not lost in that vast
repertory of plain song, (whether then ancient or
modern,) which we now call Gregorian, from the
name of the next great reformer of church music,
St. Gregory the Great.<a class="fn" id="fr_253" href="#fn_253">[253]</a> St. Ambrose died <span class="smaller">A. D.</span>
397; it was but a short time afterwards that the
great invasion of the northern barbarians took
place. The history of the vicissitudes of the
ecclesiastical music, during the general disruption
of Europe and the western civilization, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
followed, can only be imagined; but scarcely had
a calm been re-established, when, at a period when
the reforms and inventions of St. Ambrose had
not been vitiated or lost, the great reformer of
church music arose, and re-instated the art upon
a firmer pedestal than ever.</p>
<p>Gregory, the Great, born about <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 540, and
pope from September 3, 590, to March 12, 604,
was of an illustrious Roman family. His father
Gordianus, was a senator, and Felix <span class="smaller">III.</span>, one of the
early pontiffs, was among his ancestors. He was
one of the most remarkable, zealous, and intelligent
of the fathers of the church.</p>
<p>We have here only to follow his musical work,
but in every branch of work connected with his
church, he was most eminent. He founded six
monasteries in Sicily alone. He voluntarily resigned
an honorable office, to leave the world, and
seek retirement in the monastery of St. Andrew,
which he himself had founded at Rome. On this
occasion he gave to the poor all his wealth, and
declining the abbacy of his own convent, began
with the ordinary monastic life, about 575.</p>
<p>He wished to attempt the conversion of the Britains,
(moved thereto by the well known incident
of seeing some beautiful Anglo-Saxon youths
exposed for sale in the Roman market place), but
was prevented by the clamor of the populace who
refused to lose him. Like St. Ambrose, he was
called to office entirely against his will, and, on
being made pontiff, he seems to have excelled in
every department of his administration; thus
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
much, to show that music was but one of the fields
in which this wonderful man exercised his talents.</p>
<p>He collected the available church music, he
added to it by composing new hymns and anthems,
he arranged them for the various special days of
the year, he invented or amplified the system of
ecclesiastical composition, and took care that the
reforms should be permanent, by having most
things relative to his musical labors, written out
in a lasting manner.<a class="fn" id="fr_254" href="#fn_254">[254]</a></p>
<p>These reforms he began about <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 599. He
did not discard the four modes of St. Ambrose,
but rather extended them; and yet (through the
great personal popularity of St. Ambrose), the
Milan Cathedral kept the Ambrosian chant
unadulterated, for centuries after the establishment
of the Gregorian.</p>
<p>As late as the latter half of the fifteenth
century, Franchinus Gafor speaks of the Gregorians and
Ambrosians as partizans. Of course, in
order to secure uniformity, the rulers of Europe,
sought to dwarf the workings of the Ambrosian
system, and Charlemagne even ordered the
Ambrosian books to be burnt. Although, as above
stated, there was nothing antagonistic in the two
systems, yet their musical results seem to have
had a material difference, for Radulf of Tongern
an unimpeachable witness of the fourteenth
century, who heard both methods in their purity,
says that he found the Ambrosian chanting,
widely different from the Roman (Gregorian);
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
the former being strong and majestic, while the
latter was sweet-toned, and well arranged.<a class="fn" id="fr_255" href="#fn_255">[255]</a> This
distinction is utterly meaningless to us, for the
Gregorian chant is certainly majestic and strong,
at least to our ears.</p>
<p>Gregory also founded a singing school in Rome,
which was large enough to occupy two good-sized
edifices. In this he probably taught personally.</p>
<p>There have been shown as relics of his instruction,
the couch on which he sat while teaching,
and the rod with which the boys were corrected, or
awed into giving proper attention to their studies.</p>
<p>The amplification which he made in the Ambrosian
scale was the addition of four tones or plagal
modes, and also that he totally abolished the
difficult Greek nomenclature, such as <i>para-mese</i>
and <i>proslambanomenos</i>, and gave the names of
the first seven letters of the Roman alphabet, to
the seven notes, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, in
the same manner as used to-day. There is no
question but that the scale founded by Gregory,
had a diatonic character, but as to the number of
systems of tones employed, authorities differ, and
even the books of music of Gregory&rsquo;s own compilation
(one of which was chained to the altar at
St. Peters, to fix the standard of tone for ever
and ever) do not clear up the difficulty, for the
number differs.</p>
<p>But the system gradually settled itself, and
eight tones only (our ordinary diatonic scale
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
tones) were found practicable for composition and
singing.</p>
<p>Gregory&rsquo;s system was founded on the division
of the octave into two intervals; a perfect fifth and
perfect fourth. The fifth was, next to the octave,
the most important interval.</p>
<p>The added modes (called plagal, signifying
&ldquo;oblique, sideways&rdquo;), were so called to distinguish
them from the authentic tones or keys (D, E, F,
G, A), a synopsis of the entire set of tones would
be as follows,&mdash;</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="c">A, </td><td class="c">B, </td><td class="c">C, </td><td class="c">D, </td><td class="c">E, </td><td class="c">F, </td><td class="c">G, </td><td class="c">A, </td><td class="c">B, </td><td class="c">C, </td><td class="c">D,</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="4" class="cl">plagal 4,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td colspan="5" class="cl">authentic 5,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"> </td><td colspan="4" class="cl">plagal 4.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There were four authentic modes, viz.,&mdash;D,
E, F and G, and four plagal, as follows,&mdash;A,
B, C and D.</p>
<p>To give a description that would be at all
adequate, of the system of Gregory, would require
much space, and many plates and engravings.
We shall therefore touch but lightly on the tone
systems and notations of the early and middle
ages. The founding of the scale from a fifth and
fourth, led to one grave mistake; these intervals
were supposed to be of prime importance, and
more perfect than others, and finally were employed
in harmonies which were decidedly harsh.
But to such an extent did the evil spread that no
composition (in the dark ages) was thought to be
pure or classic, without containing a series of
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
fourths, fifths, and octaves, and an invariable
close upon an empty fifth. Thirds were rejected
as totally impure. But these faults are not of
Gregory&rsquo;s origination, and he must ever stand as
the man who made the connecting link between
the old Greek music and our own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<h2 id="c38"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII.</span>
<br />MUSIC IN EUROPE FROM THE FIFTH CENTURY.</h2>
<p>In proceeding to briefly sketch the curious facts
of musical history in the dark ages, we shall
necessarily confine ourselves to pointing out only
what is chiefly remarkable, and shall not enter
into the field of dispute regarding systems and
notations, for this period of Musical History is
a very hazy one. It is but natural to suppose,
that when general barbarism spread over Europe,
music was not likely to be either much practised
or written about. The last writer on the previous
systems was Boethius (the last of old Roman
writers), who lived at about the same epoch as
Gregory (he was put to death by Theodoric, the
Goth, <span class="smaller">A. D.</span> 525).</p>
<p>In his work, he uses the letters of the alphabet,
to designate musical notes, but does not repeat
the letters at the octave; his nomenclature therefore
does not end at G, but continues on, to <i>N</i>,
<i>O</i>, and <i>P</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_256" href="#fn_256">[256]</a></p>
<p>Musical progress was at a stand still from the
time of Gregory, until the reign of the Carlovingian
kings. Charlemagne at the end of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
eighth, and beginning of the ninth centuries, took
all art and music under his powerful protection.
He loved to compare himself with King David,
and had in many respects, good reason to, for he
possessed both the virtues and the failings of that
ancient monarch.</p>
<p>He gathered about him a number of musical
and literary friends, and we can judge of the
pleasant manner of their intercourse by the names
of antiquity which each one was known by.
Alcuin, was dubbed Flaccus Albinus; Riculf, Archbishop
of Mayence,&mdash;Damoetas; Arno,&mdash;Aquila;
Angilbert,&mdash;Homerus, etc.<a class="fn" id="fr_257" href="#fn_257">[257]</a></p>
<p>In addition to the literary and musical schools
founded throughout his empire, in his own palace
was one devoted to the education of the children
of his servants. Books were read, and music
sung to his courtiers, during the hours of dining
or other leisure.</p>
<p>The singing at his court, he often conducted
himself, and every one was obliged to participate.
If a stranger arrived, he was also obliged to
stand with the chorus, and even if he could not
sing, at least to make the semblance of doing so.</p>
<p>In the conservation of ancient legendary songs
Charlemagne was very active, and many which
have come down to our day, owe their existence
to his wise and thoughtful care.<a class="fn" id="fr_258" href="#fn_258">[258]</a></p>
<p>In church music he was, most of all, interested,
and remarked with much concern, the variations
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
between the Gregorian and French singing. To
put an end to the matter, he sent to Stephen <span class="smaller">IV.</span>,
the reigning pope, for ecclesiastical singers; the
latter responded by sending, (in imitation of the
twelve apostles,) twelve clerical singers to teach
his empire.</p>
<p>But these twelve apostles, turned out to be <i>all</i>
Judases, for jealous of the rising civilization of
France, they agreed among themselves, not to aid
in its rise. When therefore, they had been
received at the French court with every honor,
and were sent to their various fields of labor, it is
said, they began to sing in a most wretched manner,
and not content with that, they <i>taught</i> this
abomination to their pupils. But when Charlemagne
celebrated Christmas at Tours that year,
and in Paris the succeeding year, he heard other
Roman vocalists sing in a manner totally different,
and lost no time in making complaint to the pope,
who, calling back the untrustworthy teachers,
punished them, some with banishment, and some
with perpetual imprisonment; and in order that a
similar deceit might not again be practised, he
persuaded Charlemagne to send two French
Ecclesiastics to Rome, where under Papal supervision
they learned the true Gregorian style of
song.<a class="fn" id="fr_259" href="#fn_259">[259]</a></p>
<p>There also exists another anecdote of the ruling
of Charlemagne in church singing, which will
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
show how high partizan feeling ran in musical
matters at this era. It is as follows,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most pious King Charles having returned
to celebrate Easter at Rome with the apostolic
Lord, a great quarrel ensued during the festival,
between the Roman and Gallic singers. The
French pretended to sing better and more agreeable
than the Italians; the Italians, on the contrary,
regarding themselves as more learned in Ecclesiastical
music, in which they had been instructed by
St. Gregory, accused their competitors of corrupting,
disfiguring, and spoiling the new chant.
The dispute being brought before our sovereign
lord the king, the French, thinking themselves
sure of his countenance and support, insulted the
Roman singers; who, on their part, emboldened
by superior knowledge, and comparing the musical
abilities of their great master, St. Gregory,
with the ignorance and rusticity of their rivals,
treated them as fools and barbarians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As their altercation was not likely to come to a
speedy issue, the most pious King Charles asked
his chanters which they thought to be the purest
and best water, that which was drawn from the
source at the fountain-head, or that which after
being mixed with turbid and muddy rivulets, was
found at a great distance from the original spring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They exclaimed unanimously, that all water
must be most pure at its source; upon which our
lord the King, said, &lsquo;mount ye then up to the
pure fountain of St. Gregory, whose chant ye
have manifestly corrupted.&rsquo; After this our lord
the king, applied to Pope Adrian (the first) for
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
singing masters to convert the Gallican chant;
and the pope appointed for that purpose Theodore
and Benedict, two chanters of great learning and
abilities, who had been instructed by St. Gregory
himself; he likewise granted to him <i>Antiphonaria</i>,
or choral-books of that saint, which he had himself
written in Roman notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our lord the King, on his return to France,
sent one of the two singers granted him by the
Pope, to Metz, and the other to Soissons; commanding
all the singing masters of his kingdom to
correct their <i>antiphonaria</i>, and to conform in all
respects to the Roman manner of performing the
church service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus were the French <i>antiphonaria</i> corrected,
which had before been vitiated, interpolated, and
abridged at the pleasure of every choir man, and
all the chanters of France learned from the
Romans that chant which they now call the
French chant, which is entirely as the Roman
except that the French do not execute the tremulus
and vinnulas, the bound and staccato notes
(<i>collisibiles vel secabiles voces</i>), with facility, and
give a rather rude and throaty manner of singing.
The best style of singing remained in Metz, and
as superior as Rome is to Metz, so superior is
Metz to the rest of France, in its school of singing.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_260" href="#fn_260">[260]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>Both the above anecdotes, although quoted very
frequently, must be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>, for as
Ambros and Fetis well observe, the two singers,
if they had received instruction from Gregory,
and also taught in the era of Charlemagne, must
have been about <i>two hundred years of age</i>, which
is certainly too old for active service. Another
historian gives the names of the envoys as <i>Petrus</i>
and <i>Romanus</i>, and it is certain that one of these
did go to Metz, and that a famous school of singing
was founded at Soissons about the same time.
Both the teachers, also must have instructed the
French, in the musical characters then used in
notation, and known by the name of <i>Neumes</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Neumes</i> which were in use for musical
writing from the eighth to the twelfth century
were short lines, twirls, and hooks, which were
written above the words of a song to denote the
melody.</p>
<p>The origin of these marks, is buried in oblivion,
for they seem to have been developed, not at one
time, but gradually, and from the simplest beginnings.
Although we have not space to describe
the theories concerning them, a short explanation
of them is necessary, for from these Neumes
gradually came our modern system of notation.
At first these marks were only meant as guides to
memory; to aid the singer to sing an air which he
had previously learned. Thus the first bar of
&ldquo;Home Sweet Home,&rdquo; would be represented by
a <i>Scandicus</i> signifying three upward moving
tones, the first two short, the last one long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p>The exclamation and interrogation point, are in
language, what <i>Neumes</i> were at first in music,
they roughly sketched out the inflection of the
voice. The connection between them, and our
modern notation is very evident; in our musical
notation the requirements of the eye, have been
well attended to; not entirely perhaps, as regards
the length of notes, but certainly in the matter of
ascending and descending passages, etc.;<a class="fn" id="fr_261" href="#fn_261">[261]</a> the old
Greek notation, with its upturned and fragmentary
letters, meant nothing to the untutored eye;
but the <i>Neumes</i> of the middle ages, were the first
attempt to express a meaning <i>by their arrangement</i>.
Thus the <i>tripunctum</i> (<img class="inline" src="images/n1.jpg" alt="tripunctum" width="55" height="50" />) would denote three
notes ascending, though not which ones; it might
mean</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="c">C, </td><td class="c">D, </td><td class="c">E, </td><td class="c">or </td><td class="c">E, </td><td class="c">F, </td><td class="c">G, </td><td class="c">or </td><td class="c">F, </td><td class="c">G, </td><td class="c">A,</td></tr>

</table>
<p>etc., the <i>bipunctum</i> (<img class="inline" src="images/n2.jpg" alt="bipunctum" width="37" height="45" />)
two ascending, or (<img class="inline" src="images/n3.jpg" alt="bipunctum" width="37" height="48" />)
descending notes; the <i>plica ascendens</i>
(<img class="inline" src="images/n4.jpg" alt="plica ascendens" width="46" height="45" />) an
upward spring of a third, etc.</p>
<p>It being a system which was evolved by slow
degrees, it is not astonishing that there are various
signs, about which opinions differ. The system
though seemingly barbarous, was in reality an
improvement; although not developed so extensively
as the Greek notation which preceded it, it
bore the germ of a more natural style of musical
characters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<p>But the constant change of, and addition to the
<i>Neumes</i>, bore evidence, that it was but a pathway
to a more complete system. The next great
reformer in music gave his attention to abolishing
the uncertainty which clung around the <i>pneumata</i>.</p>
<p>Hucbald, Monk of St. Amand, in Flanders,
(born about 840, died 932,) made the first practical
effort to fix notes permanently. To him is
due the germ of the idea which afterwards
culminated in the modern clefs and staff.</p>
<p>He took (unfortunately) the Greek system for
his starting point, and this led him into many
errors, and much lessened the permanent value
of his work. He took the tetrachord (or succession
of four notes) as the foundation of music,
but he applied it in a most strange manner; his
scale was as follows:<a class="fn" id="fr_262" href="#fn_262">[262]</a></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">G, A, B flat,</p>
<p class="t0">C, D, E, F,</p>
<p class="t0">G, A, B natural,</p>
<p class="t0">C, D, E, F sharp,</p>
<p class="t0">G, A, B, C sharp,</p>
</div>
<p>it will be readily seen that the above scale contains
some incongruities, which are precisely similar to
those noticed in the music of the Hindoos; that
is the octave comes out a semi-tone sharp; B natural
being octave to B flat, F sharp to F, etc.</p>
<p>Naturally, in singing it is not to be conceived
that the singers took any such outlandish system
as to substitute this for an octave, but it must
have allowed great license to the singers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">316</span>
and the whole must have given rise to much
ambiguity.</p>
<p>His improvement in the method of notation
consisted (a perfect anticipation of clef and staff)
in placing the letters of the notes employed,
before each line of the words, and then writing
each syllable of the song, opposite to (and level
with) the note to which it belonged. As he
adopted the clumsy Greek method of lettering
(using only four letters, and placing them upright,
reversed, backwards, and sideways) we will give
an example with English letters.<a class="fn" id="fr_263" href="#fn_263">[263]</a></p>

<p>The words being &ldquo;Laudate Dominum de
c&oelig;lis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The harmony of Hucbald was as peculiar and
barbaric as his scale system.</p>
<p>He followed the principle of the ancients in
treating intervals of thirds and sixths as <i>dissonances</i>,
and therefore did not allow them to appear in
his works. In common with some of his predecessors,
he held that the only pure intervals
were fifths and fourths. To us this succession of
discords appears most appalling, but it is probable
that in the practical use of music it was ameliorated
somewhat. At this time when the organ
was in such a primitive state that the organist
struck the keys heavily with his <i>fist</i> in playing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
the left fist was sometimes allowed to hold a tone
(in the manner of an organ point), while the right
played a succession of tones with the singers.
The constant rejection of sixths and thirds as
impure intervals, must ever remain a mystery to
us; yet the effect of even this harsh and uncouth
singing was deep on those who heard it. History
tells us that King Canute was deeply impressed
on hearing the monks chant, while being rowed
in his boat, near a monastery, and a lady upon
hearing the music of the first organ erected in
France, went raving mad, from excess of emotion.</p>
<p>We will leave the rude harmonies of Hucbald,
with a final example showing the succession of
fourths used in his <i>organum</i> (or art of composing).</p>
<p>The letters T, and S, signify tone and semitone.</p>

<p>Sometimes four voices were thus written on a
staff of fifteen lines. Although this system was
so cumbrous, yet the right path had been attained,
and the progress was continual; little inventions
followed one upon the other, and many of the
modern usages in music date their rise to this
obscure age of Musical History.</p>
<p>The next great name, in the art, is that of Guido
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
Aretino, or of Arezzo, a monk of the Benedictine
order, born at Arezzo. He flourished about <span class="smaller">A. D.</span>
1030 though the date of his birth and death, is
not accurately known. His work has had more
influence in shaping modern music, than that of
any one before him. Yet much of his life and
work belongs to the hazy realm of legend. He
attained such celebrity that every invention to
which his successors could not find a father, was
attributed to him.</p>
<p>Guido&rsquo;s great success lay in the fact that he was
a <i>specialist</i>. He did not undertake, like Gregory
and Ambros, to shine in all art, science, and
enterprise; his position precluded that; he says
&ldquo;The ways of Philosophers are not mine, I only
occupy myself with what can be of use to the
church, and bring our little ones (the scholars)
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was need of such a man; for though
music teachers were sought in every country
at this time, and those from Italy, Greece, France
and even Germany, were highly prized, yet there
were many who presumed on this state of affairs,
and the consequence was that incompetent teachers
were the rule. To remedy this great evil was
the aim of Guido&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>He says some of these would-be teachers, &ldquo;If
they sang in their aimless manner, every day, for
a hundred years, they would not invent even the
slightest new Antiphon, and he who cannot easily
and correctly sing a new song, by what right can
he call himself a musician or singer?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the service of God, it too often sounds,
not as if we were praising Him, but as if we were
quarrelling, and scolding among ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He devoted himself greatly, to the teaching of
a most important branch of singing, i. e., <i>sight
reading</i>, and soon brought his cloister class to
such perfection in this that they astonished all
beholders. He was not however, as mild-mannered
a reformer as his predecessor in art,
Hucbald. His bitter sarcasms on his brother
monks, soon brought a result, and he found himself
though not actually chased from his convent,
yet ostracized in it.</p>
<p>But he was well able to sustain such a strife,
and continued his work with zeal unabated. His
style of teaching sight reading was far in advance
of his competitors, for he taught his scholars to
sing intervals, not by referring to the monochord,
but instead of it to think of some similar interval
in any hymn well known to them, thus combining
thought, memory and musical ear, in a practical
manner.</p>
<p>He was struck with the regularly ascending
intervals of the first syllables of each line of the
hymn in honor of St. John, and with the inspiration
of genius attached the syllables ut, re, mi,
fa, sol, la, to the notes, and caused his scholars to
memorize each interval, thus forming a new and
easily comprehended system of <i>Solfeggio</i>. The
hymn which inspired this wonderful stride in
music runs,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Ut</i>&mdash;queant laxis.</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Re</i>&mdash;sonare fibris.</p>

<p class="t0"><i>Fa</i>&mdash;muli tuorum.</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Sol</i>&mdash;ve polluti.</p>
<p class="t0"><i>La</i>&mdash;bia reati.</p>
<p class="t0">Sancte Johannes.</p>
</div>
<p>The fame of his wonderful results in choir-training,
soon reached Rome, and the Pope, John
<span class="smaller">XIX.</span>,<a class="fn" id="fr_264" href="#fn_264">[264]</a> sent an invitation to the still ostracized
monk, to come to Rome.</p>
<p>Guido is credited with having made many
changes in the notation and harmony of his day.
The hexachord system is attributed (justly or
unjustly) to him. He also is said to have introduced
lines of different colors into the staff, for
the purpose of aiding the singer to recognize certain
notes with more facility. He says in his
<i>Micrologus</i><a class="fn" id="fr_265" href="#fn_265">[265]</a>
&ldquo;In order that sounds may be discerned
with certainty, we mark some lines with
various colors, so that the eye may immediately
distinguish a note, in whatever place it may be.
For the third of the scale [C] a bright saffron
line. The sixth [F] adjacent to C is of bright
vermilion, and the proximity of others to these
colors, will be an index to the whole. If there
were neither letter, nor colored lines to the
Neumes, it would be like having a well without
a rope&mdash;the water plentiful, but of no use to those
who see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Guido does not lay claim to having
invented the colored lines, it is probable that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
brought them, by his influence into much more
general use.</p>
<p>He certainly invented a modification of the
line system of Hucbald. Instead of the inverted
letters, and fragments of letters which the latter
used, he employed the vowels only, to designate
the pitch, thus,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maria, veri solis mater, ubera tuos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guido, altered Hucbald&rsquo;s <i>Organum</i> in so far,
that he rejected consecutive fifths, as being too
harsh, and substituted a series of consecutive
fourths as being milder.</p>
<p>It may not be out of place to remark here, that
the present scrupulous avoidance of all consecutive
fifths, in modern composition of strict school,
is simply a reaction from the rude taste of past
centuries, which employed them <i>ad nauseum</i>;
there is no valid reason for their complete ostracism,
any more than there was cause for the banishing
of all sixths and thirds from the harmony
of our ancestors. To Guido is also attributed the
invention of the method of the harmonical hand
(Guidonian hand, as it has been named after its
supposed originator). This consisted of marking
certain notes and musical signs on the tips of the
fingers, and by this means more readily committing
them to memory. As before stated, many
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
of the inventions credited to Guido, are only
adaptations. The Sol-faing system was almost
an accidental occurrence; yet only genius can
derive full profit from accidents. The hymn
which gave rise to it (quoted above), is a most
prosaic invocation to St. John to save the throats
of the singers from hoarseness, in order that they
may fittingly sing his praise. A very diplomatic
way of requesting it.</p>
<p>Musical history in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh
centuries is at its darkest; hence little is positively
known of the life of Guido. It is certain that he
was in great favor at Rome, and that other countries
applied to him for his musical services to
reorganize their ecclesiastical chanting, and also
that his health failing, he returned to his monastery,
forgetting and forgiving the ill treatment he
had received there, and in its cloisters peacefully
ended his days.</p>
<p>The date of his decease is not known.</p>
<p>Other names appear in this misty epoch in
musical history. Franco of Cologne, Walter
Odington, an English Monk, Heeronymus von
Maehren, etc., wrote works upon the theory of
music, while Adam de la Hale (of Arras, France)
wrote music in four-part harmony, about the year
1280. But in the midst of this darkness there
came a glorious sunburst in the shape of chivalric
bands who elevated music to a broader sphere by
adding to the ecclesiastical chanting a secular
school of composition, both warlike and lyrical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<h2 id="c39"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII.</span>
<br />THE ANCIENT BARDS.</h2>
<p>While Rome and Milan were devoting themselves
almost entirely to ecclesiastical music, there
had sprung up among the barbarian nations a
school of music more consonant to their habits,
being warlike in its style, and having for its
object the celebration of the heroes of each country,
and the inciting of their descendants to similar
deeds of glory. From earliest days Wales has
possessed a guild of such singers, who were, in
fact, the historians of the country, at a time when
written books would have been nearly useless.
The songs of the Welsh bards have been preserved
traditionally by that people; while the songs of
the druids who preceded them have been allowed
to pass into utter oblivion, the latter having,
evidently, not taken deep root in Welsh soil.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the sixth century,
the bards of Wales exerted all their energies of
exhortation to animate their countrymen in the
strife with the Saxon invaders, and when Wales
was conquered by Edward <span class="smaller">I.</span>, (1284) he dreaded
their influence so much that he is said to have
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
persecuted them and put them to death. The
bards in Wales had an organization similar to
that which we shall presently find among the
troubadours and minne-singers. They were divided
into two classes,&mdash;poets, and musicians. Each
of these classes were subdivided into three divisions.
The first class of poet-bards was composed
of those who understood history, and dabbled somewhat
in sorcery, thus being held in awe as prophets
and diviners. The second class consisted of bards
attached to private families, whose duties were to
chant the praises of the heroes of their particular
house. The third class were the heraldic bards,
who wrote the national annals and prescribed the
laws of etiquette and precedence. These must
have exerted a powerful influence on a nation
which clung so strictly to ceremony and the privileges
of lineage.</p>
<p>The musicians were also divided into three
classes, of which the first were harpers, and possessed
the title of Doctors of Music; the second
class were the players upon the <i>crouth</i> or <i>chrotta</i>,
a smaller stringed instrument; the third class consisted
of the singers. Many laws and regulations
were made to define the privileges of each class,
and the classification of new bards took place at
an assemblage called the Eisteddfod, which met
triennially, and conferred degrees. The highest
degree could only be obtained after nine years
faithful study. From the thirteenth century
Wales also possessed a class of wandering musicians
entitled, &ldquo;<i>Clery dom</i>.&rdquo; The harps used
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
were various, though the three-stringed one was
the national instrument. One variety was made
of leather, strung with wire, and is said to have
been peculiarly harsh; another called <i>isgywer</i> was
so small that it could be played on horseback;
another was strung with hair. The order of the
bards was hereditary to some extent. King Howel
Dha issued edicts regarding them (fixing their
rank) about 940 <span class="smaller">A. D.</span>, and in 1078 the whole
order was reformed and full regulations made by
Gryffith ap Conan. In spite of the persecutions
to which they were subjected, the order was sustained
for centuries, and <i>Eisteddfods</i> were held
under royal commission down to the reign of
Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>In Ireland minstrelsy has had a foothold in all
times. There is a legend that about the year 365
<span class="smaller">B. C.</span>, there occurred in Ireland the first triumph
of poetry and music. A young prince, driven
from his throne by a usurper, was so moved by a
song which his betrothed wrote and caused Craftine,
a celebrated bard, to sing to him, that he
resolved on hazarding a supreme effort to regain
his crown, and succeeded in driving the usurper
from his kingdom.</p>
<p>The Irish claim that they were the originators
of the Welsh system of bards, but this statement
seems to be founded rather on national pride
than upon fact, for it is probable that the borrowing
was upon the other side. But it is certain
that the Irish have ever possessed musical taste
and skill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_326">326</div>
<p>Gyraldus Cambriensis (who wrote in the twelfth
century) says of them: &ldquo;The aptitude of this
people for performing upon musical instruments
is worthy of attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have in this respect, much more ability
than any nation I have ever seen. The modulations
are not with them slow and sad, like those
of the instruments of Britain, to which we are
accustomed, but the sounds, though rapid and
precipitate, are yet sweet and soothing.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_266" href="#fn_266">[266]</a> The
harp was, as in Wales, the national instrument.
The bards were a hereditary class, and their guild,
as in Wales, had three divisions; the <i>Filedha</i>,
who sang both about religious and martial subjects,
and were also heralds to the nobility; <i>Braitheamhain</i>,
who chanted the laws; and the <i>Seanachaidehe</i>,
who were the musical and poetical
chroniclers and historians. Their influence and
privileges were fully as great as those of their
Welsh brethren, and they had many valuable
possessions of land. Their skill was universally
acknowledged up to their conquest by Henry <span class="smaller">II.</span>,
but from that epoch the profession began to
decline, although noble families still made it a
point of honor to keep private bards to sing to
them of the deeds of the ancestors of their
house.</p>
<p>The influence which these songs exerted in
fomenting rebellion was such, that severe laws
were promulgated against them in England, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
under Elizabeth all the Irish bards who were
captured, were hanged.</p>
<p>The last Irish hard existed as late as the eighteenth
century.</p>
<p>Turlogh O&rsquo;Carolan was born 1670, and died
1737; worthily closing the long reign of the fiery
minstrel guild of Ireland.</p>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s bardism, was similar to that of
Wales and Ireland, but the ranks and privileges
are less known. The bag-pipe was played as
much as the harp, and there was much analogy in
the ancient music of Ireland and Scotland. The
scale on which the Scotch pieces were founded,
bears much resemblance to the Chinese, and to
some of the Hindoo modes.</p>
<p>In England there were also bards, but there
was not an order, as in the preceding countries,
and at a time when these heraldic singers were so
highly honored in Wales, the singers and musicians
of England were held in very slight social
estimation. The irruptions of the Danes, and
Norsemen generally, upon England in the ninth,
tenth and eleventh centuries, brought a taste of
the forcible Northern <i>sagas</i> along with them, and
when King Canute held the throne, bards and
&ldquo;<i>gleemen</i>,&rdquo; were protected and favored, for King
Canute was very fond of song. He, himself,
wrote a song which was for a long time the
favorite ballad of England.</p>
<p>The circumstances which prompted it were as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>He was being rowed near the Monastery of
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
Ely, in the evening, when the sound of the monks
singing their vesper chants, came across the
water; he was greatly moved by the beauty of
the song, which, with the accessories of the tranquil
evening, the rippling water, and the measured
stroke of the oars, caused him to improvise upon
the spot, a song which soon spread among the
peasantry as well as the higher classes.</p>
<p>Only one stanza has been preserved of this
interesting effusion,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Merie sungen the muneches binnen Ely,</p>
<p class="t0">Tha Cnute Ching, reu ther by</p>
<p class="t0">Rowe cnihtes, n&aelig;w the land,</p>
<p class="t0">And here we thes muneches s&aelig;ng,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>which may be rendered in English thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sweetly sang the Monks of Ely,</p>
<p class="t0">As King Canute rowed there by,</p>
<p class="t0">Row men, nearer to the shore</p>
<p class="t0">And hear we these Monks&rsquo; song.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The minstrels of England from the first, took
a more peaceful and religious turn than those of
Wales and Ireland. The most of the really
authentic pieces of their era, take the shape of
Christmas carols.</p>

<br />THE TROUBADOURS AND MINNE-SINGERS.</h2>
<p>We now come to an era in music, where the
most cultivated minds gave their attention to the
art; and where it is no longer confined to the
narrow channels of ecclesiastical, and even heraldic
and martial use, but finds a broader outlet in
the subjects of Love, and Nature. The troubadours
were gentlemen (often knights), who held
themselves totally distinct from those musicians
who wrote for pay. The rise of chivalry in the
middle ages, elevated woman from an unjustly
low position, to an absurdly high one. She was
held to be the arbiter of Fate; the Queen to whom
all service was due; and was almost religiously
worshipped. From this exaggerated devotion
arose the school of troubadour and minne-singer
composition. When knights racked their brains,
as to what new offering they could bring to their
lady, it was but natural that they should find, in
the combination of poetry and song, a series of
never-ending tributes with which they could pay
homage to their chosen one.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine that once launched into
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
this fertile field, they would not wholly confine
themselves to Love, but that an occasional poem
on Nature, or War, would attest their versatility
so that even the puerile &ldquo;Courts of Love,&rdquo; of
the chivalric age, brought a general onward impulse
to art; it was not to be expected that the
knights could step at once from a condition of
rudeness, to a state of culture, and it is not surprising
to see a vast exaggeration of politeness,
where little had been before.</p>
<p>In the beautiful country of Provence (South
France), this branch of art took its rise. The
lyrical songs of the troubadours were written in
the Provencal tongue, which soon became, for all
South France the court language for amatory
poetry. It was called also the <i>Langue d&rsquo;oc</i> (from
the affirmative &ldquo;<i>Oc</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes&rdquo;), to distinguish
it from the <i>Lingua di Si</i> (Italian) and the
<i>Langue d&rsquo;&ouml;il</i> (North France); the name afterwards
was attached to another province of
France. The Trouv&egrave;res, were the poets and
minstrels of North France, and wrote in the
<i>langue d&rsquo;&ouml;il</i>. They wrote chiefly epic poetry,
(fables, tales and romances), while the lyrical
school was left to their southern competitors.</p>
<p>The troubadours composed and sang their own
songs, but did not play their own accompaniments;
that branch of music was turned over to
hired musicians, called <i>jongleurs</i>.</p>
<p>Celebrated troubadours had often several <i>jongleurs</i>
in their employ. Those who made music a
means of gaining a livelihood, were classed much
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
lower. All in fact who did not invent (&ldquo;<i>Trobar</i>,&rdquo;
to find, or invent, whence comes the word trobador)
their own songs, but sang or accompanied
others, were called <i>jongleurs</i>, which was about as
ordinary a trade as that of our perambulating
&ldquo;jugglers;&rdquo; whose name is only a corruption
of the more ancient calling.</p>
<p>The troubadours had a position which was even
better than that of the bards of Wales or Ireland.
They also made a livelihood of music, but in a far
more genteel way than their humbler assistants,
who were proscribed for so doing. The first
thing the troubadour did, on practising his art
was to seek out some person on whom to bestow
his heart. This person was almost invariably a
married lady. To her, he would then dedicate all
his lays; he would (bestowing upon her, an
assumed name), sing of her beauties, and entreat
her favors; he would sneer at the charms of other
dames, and sometimes satirize them.</p>
<p>The feelings of the husband during all this can
&ldquo;better be imagined than described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet often the dame, may have been totally
indifferent to his ardor. We feel sure that at
times this was the case, for husbands are known
to have begged their wives to accept the troubadour&rsquo;s
flattery, and keep him on, with slight
encouragement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the singers went on from Court to
Court, received as equals, by the highest; flattered
and sought for by the most brilliant circles,
and fairest ladies. Often they attached themselves
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
to some particular prince, and gained his
favor and enriched themselves by singing <i>sirventes</i>
(songs of service) in his honor, and in derision of
his enemies.</p>
<p>The nobles and kings of that era, also took up
the Troubadour&rsquo;s lyre, at times. Richard <span class="smaller">I.</span>,
Alfonso <span class="smaller">X.</span>, William <span class="smaller">IX.</span> Count of Poitiers and
others were famous for their efforts in this line,
and they richly patronized such troubadours as
sought them.</p>
<p>The gifts with which a successful song was
rewarded, were of course influenced by the liberality
of the giver. Horses, richly caparisoned,
elegant vestments, and money, are mentioned in
this connection.<a class="fn" id="fr_267" href="#fn_267">[267]</a> Meanwhile the troubadours
occasionally display the utmost contempt for their
assistants, the before mentioned <i>jongleurs</i>, and
reproach nobles, in some verses, with receiving
such persons (who play at village fairs, dance on
the tight rope, and exhibit performing monkeys),
into their castles. Yet not all of the poets shared
in this feeling, for Boccaccio tells us that Dante
loved to associate with the musicians who set his
<i>canzone</i> to music. In the thirteenth century,
Guirant Riquier (called the &ldquo;last of the troubadours&rdquo;)
complains to the king of Castile, Alfonso
<span class="smaller">X.</span>, of the decadence of the troubadour&rsquo;s art, and
attributes it to the indiscriminate mixing of
troubadours and jongleurs, in popular estimation.
He says&mdash;&ldquo;You know that all men live in classes
differing and distinguished from each other.
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
Therefore it seems to me that such a distinction
of names ought also to be made amongst the
joglars; for it is unjust that the best of them
should not be distinguished by name as well as
they are by deed. It is unfair that an ignorant
man of small learning, who knows a little how to
play some instrument, and strums it in public
places, for whatever people will give him, or one
who sings low ditties to low people about the
streets and taverns, and takes alms without shame
from the first comer,&mdash;that all these should indiscriminately
go by the name of joglars ...
for joglaria was invented by wise men to give joy
to good people by their skill in playing on instruments....
After that came the troubadours
to record valiant deeds, and to praise the good,
and encourage them in their noble endeavor....
But in our days, and for some time past,
a set of people without sense and wisdom have
undertaken to sing and compose stanzas and play
on instruments,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_268" href="#fn_268">[268]</a> etc.</p>
<p>The poor troubadour desired the king to classify
them, and to title the best. The king&rsquo;s answer is
extant, wherein he endeavored to do so, but as
the real essence and life had departed from the
whole institution, it was unavailing.</p>
<p>The troubadours often had poetical combats,
when they would indulge in a verse-battle about
some &ldquo;Law of Love,&rdquo; and the judges were
selected from the fairest and wittiest of the noble
dames. These were called the &ldquo;Courts of Love.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_334">334</div>
<p>The muse of some of them seems to have taken
a most curious turn, for there are still in existence
some &ldquo;<i>Essenhamens</i>,&rdquo; or books of etiquette for
young ladies, which emanated from these lyrical
pens, which are of the quaintest description.
We reproduce a quotation from one, written by
&ldquo;Amanieus des Escas, called God of Love.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_269" href="#fn_269">[269]</a></p>
<p>In this treatise we are supplied with a minute
account of the accomplishments expected from a
well educated young lady, and of the bad habits
most prejudicial to her character. The poet is
supposed to be addressing a noble damsel living at
the court of some great baron, as a sort of &lsquo;lady
help&rsquo; to his wife; this being a not unusual, and
undoubtedly a most efficient method of polite
education in Provence. The young lady has
accosted Amanieus on a lonely walk, asking for his
advice in matters fashionable. This the poet at
first refuses to tender, alleging that &ldquo;you (the
damsel) have ten times as much sense as I, and
that is the truth!&rdquo; But after his modest scruples
are once overcome, he launches forth into a flood
of good counsel. He systematically begins with
enforcing the good old doctrine of &lsquo;early to rise,&rsquo;
touches delicately on the mysteries of the toilet,
such as lacing, washing of arms, hands, and head,
which, he sententiously adds, ought to go before
the first mentioned process, and, after briefly
referring to the especial care required by teeth
and nails, he leaves the dressing room for the
church, where a quiet undemonstrative attitude is
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
recommended; the illicit use of the eyes and
tongue being mentioned amongst the temptations
peculiarly to be avoided.</p>
<p>Directions of similar minuteness assist the
young lady at the dinner table; the cases in which
it would be good taste, and those in which it
would be the reverse, to invite persons to a share
of the dishes within her reach are specified; and
the rules as to carving, washing one&rsquo;s hands
before and after dinner, and similar matters, leave
nothing to be desired. &lsquo;Always temper your
wine with water, so that it cannot do you harm,&rsquo;
is another maxim of undeniable wisdom.</p>
<p>After dinner follows the time of polite conversation
in the sala (drawing room), the arbour, or
on the battlements of the castle; and now the
teachings of Amanieus become more and more
animated, and are enlivened occasionally by practical
illustrations of great interest. &ldquo;And if at
this season,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;a gentleman takes you
aside, and wishes to talk of courtship to you, do
not show a strange or sullen behavior, but defend
yourself with pleasant repartees. And if his talk
annoys you; and makes you uneasy, I advise you
to ask him questions, for instance:&mdash;&lsquo;Which
ladies do you think are more handsome, those of
Gascony or of England, and which are more
courteous, and faithful, and good? And if he
says those of Gascony, answer without hesitation;
Sir, by your leave, English ladies are more courteous
than those of any other country. But if he
prefers those of England, tell him Gascon ladies
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
are much better behaved, and thus carry on the
discussion, and call your companions to you to
decide the questions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We also give two extracts from the poems of that
famous troubadour, Bertrand De Born. He was
a poet far more given to martial songs, than to
the lyrical muse. His enemies dreaded his pen
as much as his sword. He describes his belligerent
qualities without any exaggeration, for he
was literally never contented except when at war
with some of his neighbors. One of his poems
(addressed to a lady) begins smoothly enough,
but before he is half done, he breaks into an
abrupt praise of fighting.</p>
<p>In the following, he warns Williams of Gordon,
against Richard of Poitou, and hurls invective at
the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you well,&rdquo; Bertrand says, &ldquo;but my
enemies want to make a fool and a dupe of you,
and the time seems long to them before they see
you in their ranks.&rdquo; &ldquo;To Perigeux, close to the
wall, so that I can throw my battle axe over it,
I will come well armed, and riding on my horse,
Bayard; and if I find the glutton of Poitou<a class="fn" id="fr_270" href="#fn_270">[270]</a> he
shall know the cut of my sword. A mixture of
brain and splinters of iron he shall wear on his
brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here follows a frank avowal of his delight in
war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day long,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I fight, and am at
work, to make a thrust at them and defend myself,
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
for they are laying waste my land, and burning
my crops; they pull up my trees by the roots,
and mix my corn with the straw. Cowards and
brave men are my enemies. I constantly disunite
and sow hatred among the barons, and then
remould and join them together again, and try to
give them brave hearts and strong; but I am a
fool for my trouble, for they are made of base
metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot better take leave of the troubadours
than by giving two additional specimens of the
writing of Bertrand de Born.</p>
<p>The first is an ingenious poem. He has quarreled
with his lady, and as a means of reconciliation
he borrows from all the famous beauties of
his time, their special charm, and gives them all
to his love. The second song will explain itself.<a class="fn" id="fr_271" href="#fn_271">[271]</a></p>

<p>The Trouv&egrave;res, were, as before intimated, the
poet-musicians of North France. They wrote in
a much more matter-of-fact manner than the
troubadours, and wrote in the <i>Langue d&rsquo;&ouml;il</i>, while
the latter wrote in the <i>Langue d&rsquo;oc</i>; two tongues
as dissimilar as French and Italian, or English
and Dutch.</p>
<p>There existed lady troubadours and trouv&egrave;res;
the works of some of them are extant, and do not
in any way compare unfavorably with those of
the other sex. Of course there are several
solitary cases where the Norman poet would write
a love song, and the Provencal a fable, but the
general tendency was as above indicated.</p>
<p>Contemporary with the troubadours and trouv&egrave;res,
there arose in Germany, a similar order of
singers, whose productions have been preserved,
even more copiously than those of the southrons.</p>
<p>The minne-singers began their career in Germany,
under the glorious reign of Barbarossa,
(Frederic <span class="smaller">I.</span>) in the last half of the twelfth century.
The first name which we meet with is Henry of
Veldig, yet it is a singular fact that he, the first
of a new order of singers, begins by complaining
of the decadence of the true minne-lied (love-song.)
The word minne-singer means simply
love-singer, i. e.&mdash;singer of love-songs. We give
here, a verse of this early love-song, and have
endeavored to give a translation, preserving the
original metre (as nearly literal as possible) below
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Do man der rehten minne pflag</p>
<p class="t">Da pflag man ouch der ehren;</p>
<p class="t0">Nu mag man naht und tag</p>
<p class="t">Die b&ouml;sen sitte leren:</p>
<p class="t0">Swer dis nu siht, und jens do sach,</p>
<p class="t">O we! was der nu clagen mag</p>
<p class="t0">Tugende wend sich nu verkehren.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When true love had its proper sway,</p>
<p class="t">Then honour too, was nourished</p>

<p class="t0">Who knows the past and present way,</p>
<p class="t">Oh Woe! how well complain he may</p>
<p class="t0">Since every virtue now has perished.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Almost all the lays of the minne-singers were
written in the Swabian dialect which was then the
court language of Germany. As a rule, their
grace and elegance of diction was superior to that
of the troubadours. They did not, like the latter,
hire accompanists, or jongleurs, but played their
own accompaniments on a viol. As in the South,
emperors, princes, and knights, were proud to be
known as minne-singers.</p>
<p>There exists a little epigram (ascribed to Frederic
<span class="smaller">II.</span>,) which we are tempted to reproduce, as it
gives an insight to the qualities which were
esteemed at that time.</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t">And Castilian dignity</p>

</div>
<p>The love songs of the Germans were not so fiery
as those of Provence; while the adoration of the
troubadour for his love went all lengths, the German
knight rendered to his own a much quieter,
(and chaster) species of homage. There were not
such criminal passions (often ending in murder at
the hands of the outraged husband) as in France.
In epic poems this school was very successful, and
that stateliest of German poems, &ldquo;The <i>Nibelungen-lied</i>,&rdquo;
dates from about this time, although its
author is not known.</p>
<p>The preservation of many of the songs of the
Minne-singers is due to Rudiger of Manesse, a
senator of Zurich (fourteenth century). To those
who are desirous of seeing the main part of his
collection we cannot do better than to recommend
the excellent work of F. von der Hagen, (&ldquo;<i>Minne-s&auml;nger</i>,&rdquo;
<i>Manessische Sammlung</i>), in which all
the gems of this early growth of medi&aelig;val poetry
are given. One peculiar species of their songs
were called &ldquo;<i>Wacht-lieder</i>&rdquo; (Watch-songs), and
represent the pleading of the knight, with the
watchman of the castle, for admittance to his
love; or the warning of the watchman to the lover
<span class="pb" id="Page_344">344</span>
in the castle, to avoid discovery by leaving while
it was yet dark. We present the reader with a
specimen (author unknown).</p>

<p>But the glory of the minne-singers was but
short; the emperors of the house of Swabia, had
fostered the art, by allowing an unheard-of liberty
of speech and thought; with the downfall of that
house (1256 <span class="smaller">A. D.</span>) the church regained a continually-increasing
ascendancy, and this liberty was
again fettered. Song and poetry, especially of an
amatory or frivolous (?) character were condemned,
and the place of the pleasant school of
minne-singer poetry was usurped by paraphrases
of the Scriptures, hymns or legends, written
either in very weak German or bad Latin; the
school of German poetry took a very long retrograde
step. Before leaving the minne-singers, a
word must be said of their fables and tales; in
these we find many modern ideas in a quaint and
ancient dress, proverbs abound, and many tales
of Roman History. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t set the wolf to guard
the Sheep,&rdquo; &ldquo;Never borrow trouble,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The king must die,</p>
<p class="t0">And so must I,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and many other sage thoughts.</p>
<p>The tales are sometimes very prettily told. We
have thought it worth while to translate one,
which we believe, has not yet been seen in an
English dress.</p>
<p>As far as possible we have adhered to the
abruptness and quaintness of the original.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time there was a king, who had but
one son, who was very dear to him; the son
demanded leave of absence from his father, and
said that he wished to see the world, and wished
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
to make friends. Then the king spoke &lsquo;that
pleases me well; but see that you do not have
your labor in vain.&rsquo; The son was made ready for
his journey, and remained seven years away;
after that he returned to his home and his father,
which pleased the father very much, and he said,&mdash;&lsquo;Dear
son: how many friends hast thou earned
in these three years? Then the son answered
&lsquo;only three; the first I love better than myself;
the second as much as myself; and the third, not
as well as myself.&rsquo; The father said &lsquo;It is well
to have friends, and it is well to try them; I counsel
you to kill a hog, and put it in a sack, and go
in the night to your friends and say, you met an
old enemy on the street and killed him, and are
afraid that if the dead body should be found on
you, it would cost you your life, and beg him
that he should, in such extremity, help you, and
that he will allow you to bury the body in his
house, that it may not be found on you; so you
shall find out if you have good friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This advice pleased the son well, so he went
back again to the city where he knew he should
find his friends; and killed one night, a hog, and
did as his father had advised him to, and came to
the friend whom he loved better than himself.
When this one had heard his story, he said:&mdash;&lsquo;you
killed him yourself, so suffer for it yourself;
if it were found by me it would cost me my life;
but because we are good friends and comrades,
when you are caught, and when they are about to
bill you, I will go to you, and will console you,
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
and will buy many ells of cloth for you, wherein
they may wind you and bury you; because you
loved me more than yourself.&rsquo; When he heard
this, he answered nothing but went to the other
friend whom he loved as much as himself, and
knocked at his door with the same tale as he had
told to the first; this one said:&mdash;&lsquo;Dear one! do
you suppose I am such a simpleton that I want to
die for you? If it is found here then I must die;
but if they kill you, then I will comfort you,
because that we are friends, and will do it the
best I can, since we must all die.&rsquo; When he
heard this, he parted from him, and came to the
third friend whom he did not love as well as himself.
This one asked what was in the sack, which
he came with. He said:&mdash;&lsquo;I can not say well,
but I need help in this day; yet know that it has
been my fate to kill a man, and I carry his body
on my back, and if it is caught by me, then I
must die, therefore I call on you for counsel;
This one spoke;&mdash;&lsquo;Give me here the body, and
let me carry it myself, for I will even die for you,&rsquo;
and when he opened the sack he found that only
a dead hog lay therein. After that the son went
home and told the whole story to his father.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_276" href="#fn_276">[276]</a></p>
<p>The end is of rather startling abruptness; we
should have liked to have heard of the rewards
and punishment, <i>a la</i> modern novel.</p>
<p>One song took its rise at this time which is even
to-day a popular one, the world over. We refer to
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">349</span>
the music of the song now known as, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
go Home till morning,&rdquo; or &ldquo;For he&rsquo;s a jolly good
fellow;&rdquo; and known in France as &ldquo;Malbrook
s&rsquo;en va-t-en Guerre.&rdquo; This was a favorite air at
the time of the crusades, and the crusaders often
made it resound before Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Arabs first knew the melody and have
retained it to this day. The Arab fellahs will
listen apathetically to the whole repertoire of a
European orchestra; but the moment that the
above tune is played, the whole aspect changes,
and instead of a lifeless audience, the performers
have the most enthusiastic of listeners.<a class="fn" id="fr_277" href="#fn_277">[277]</a> In the
course of descent from the Crusaders and ancient
musicians, the tune has become a little quicker
but is not changed in any material respect.</p>
<p>Some time after the decline of Minne-singing,
an attempt was made to revive its glories, by
musical competitions, somewhat similar in style;
but the essence of the real &ldquo;Minne&rdquo; was gone;
it was no longer the knight singing to his love, or
telling in unaffected verse, the beauties of
Nature. Instead of this, there was a competition
of burgers and tradespeople, affecting a passion
foreign to their nature, and caring far more for a
stilted style of verse, than for the subject of it.
Such were the Meister-singers;<a class="fn" id="fr_278" href="#fn_278">[278]</a> Nuremburg was
their chief seat, and like all the tradesmen of that
age, they made their Guild a very close one. No
one could be admitted as a Master, unless he
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
invented a new style of rhyme. Almost all the
members came from the lower classes, and the
result of such tyros endeavoring to strike out
paths which would have been difficult even to
genius, can be imagined.</p>
<p>Hans Sachs (a Nuremberg shoe-maker) and a
couple of others, were probably all that sang with
real poetic feeling.</p>
<p>Their songs were also accompanied with music.
There was a severe set of rules regulating the
poetical and musical contests; and the Guild
spread over all Germany; the last vestige of it
did not disappear until as recently as 1839.</p>
<p>But while this stultified mode of music was
going on in Nuremberg, a truer musical plant was
growing beside it: at this time the Volks-lied
(folk song) took its rise in Germany.</p>
<p>The first form of the volks-lied was religious,
and it was of a simplicity which adapted it to the
wants of the people. The pedantry of the Meister-singers
had an excellent effect upon this class
of composition, for it added counterpoint and
harmony (even if driven to excess) to a class of
music which was able to bear it.</p>
<p>Another order of music was that connected with
the miracle plays, where scriptural events were
represented upon the stage, with music. Much
of this music was taken bodily from the ecclesiastical
chants of the period.</p>
<p>With the commencement of the reformation,
the music of Germany was lifted to a very elevated
sphere, in being applied to the stately chorals
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
which came into general use, through the efforts
of Luther, who himself composed some of them.
Luther had a most musical nature, which left its
imprint upon his whole epoch.</p>
<p>It is related of him, that he spent the largest
part of the night before he appeared to define his
doctrines before the Diet of Worms, playing on
his lute, in order to give composure and firmness
to his thoughts.</p>
<p>He ranked music next to theology, and said:&mdash;&ldquo;I
am not ashamed to acknowledge, that next to
divinity there is no study which I prize so highly
as that of music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the reformation, the epoch of modern
music may be said to begin. Of course there was
both crudity and pedantry in the art, but the
Meister-singers, although they yet existed centuries
later, had ceased to exert an influence.</p>
<p>There are but few curious facts, which are not
generally known, from that age, to our own. Yet
we think a brief sketch of the growth of some
branches of our music, will not be uninteresting
to the general reader, even if the facts have lost
the relish of novelty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_352">352</div>
<h2 id="c41"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV.</span>
<br />CURIOSITIES OF THE OPERA.
<br />MODERN COMPOSERS, AND CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p>Our series of sketches now draws towards its
close. The rise of the many-voiced harmony in
Italy, France, Germany, England, and the Netherlands,
the contrapuntal works of Palestrina,
Dufay, De Lattre, etc., come rather under the
head of the history and science of music, than
within the scope of a work which only endeavors
to collect the curiosities of the art, and things not
generally known. But in the rise and progress
of the opera, we find some interesting facts which
belong to our subject, and which bring our chain
of sketches down to the music of our own times.</p>
<p>The opera was the legitimate offspring of the
Miracle plays of the Middle ages, which were only
sacred operas or oratorios, wherein some events
in the life of a holy personage were represented
with songs and acting. The first opera (being
exactly like a &ldquo;mystery play,&rdquo; except that the
subject was a secular one) was &ldquo;Orpheus,&rdquo; by
Angelo Poliziano, and was performed in Rome in
1480. The libretto was by Cardinal Riario (nephew
of Pope Sixtus <span class="smaller">IV.</span>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_353">353</div>
<p>Pope Clement <span class="smaller">IX.</span>, wrote seven librettos for
operas. All was not sung in these: they were
rather tragedies with choruses.<a class="fn" id="fr_279" href="#fn_279">[279]</a></p>
<p>In 1500 the popes possessed a theatre, with
decorations and machinery. The paintings in
this edifice were by Balthazar Peruzzi, who may
be said to be the father of scene painting. His
scenery is said to have been very realistic.</p>
<p>Julian de Medicis, brother of Leon <span class="smaller">X.</span>, on being
proclaimed a citizen of Rome gave public plays,
and had a comedy of Plautus presented for two
days, the music of which was much admired.</p>
<p>In 1574, Claudio Merulo, organist at St. Mark&rsquo;s,
composed music to a drama, which was performed
in the presence of Henry <span class="smaller">III.</span>, of France.</p>
<p>Vincent Galileo, father of the astronomer, and
Giovanni Bardi invented the recitative at about
the same time.</p>
<p>Peri and Caccini, two of the best musicians of
Florence were engaged by two rich noblemen to
write for them a complete opera; <i>Dafne</i>, produced
in Florence (1597,) was the result, and was the
first complete opera in modern form; these
composers were therefore the originators of the
opera.</p>
<p>An opera by the same writers was given at the
wedding of Henry <span class="smaller">IV.</span>, and Marie de Medici.
Rinucci, the author of the <i>libretti</i> of both the
above was silly enough to imagine that Marie de
Medici loved him, and followed her into France
<span class="pb" id="Page_354">354</span>
the ridicule which he received for his conceit
soon sent him back to Italy.</p>
<p>The score of &ldquo;Orpheus,&rdquo; by Monteverde,
1608, allows us to see the construction of his
orchestra.</p>
<p>There were,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">2 Clavichords,</p>
<p class="t0">2 Lyres, or Grand Viols (13 strings),</p>
<p class="t0">10 Violas,</p>
<p class="t0">3 Bass Viols,</p>
<p class="t0">2 Double Bass,</p>
<p class="t0">1 Double Harp (2 rows of strings),</p>
<p class="t0">2 Small French Violins,</p>
<p class="t0">2 Great Guitars,</p>
<p class="t0">2 Organs (wood),</p>
<p class="t0">4 Trombones,</p>
<p class="t0">1 Pair of Regals (small organ),</p>
<p class="t0">2 Cornets,</p>
<p class="t0">1 Small Flute,</p>
<p class="t0">1 Clarion,</p>
<p class="t0">3 Sourdines (muted trumpets).</p>
</div>
<p>These instruments gave to each chorus and
character a different effect, thus the double basses
accompanied Orpheus; the viols, Euridice; the
trombones, Pluto; the regals, Apollo. The shepherd&rsquo;s
choruses were accompanied by flute, cornets,
sourdines and clarion, and most singular of
all, Charon sang to the light tones of the <i>guitar</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_280" href="#fn_280">[280]</a></p>
<p>In Italy, from this time forth, opera followed
opera.</p>
<p>In France it was not known till much later
<span class="pb" id="Page_355">355</span>
plays &ldquo;with songs&rdquo; were known however, and
one of these, &ldquo;in the Italian style,&rdquo; was performed
in Paris, before the King and Royal
family, on the occasion of the victory of the Duke
of Guise at Calais, 1558.</p>
<p>The chief representations for years after, lay
rather in the direction of ballets, than of operas.
Religious plays also still were given at Paris, but
after the ordinance, of 1548, that no Catholic
ceremony should be represented on the stage,
they disappeared.<a class="fn" id="fr_281" href="#fn_281">[281]</a></p>
<p>The theatres, that is those which were public,
were at this time very poorly appointed, but
through the constant festivities of the court,
many inventions came into use.</p>
<p>The Court of France had always a <i>penchant</i> for
music, the drama, and dancing. Henry <span class="smaller">IV.</span>, was
very fond of the latter.</p>
<p>Louis <span class="smaller">XIII.</span>, cultivated music with much success,
he composed many airs, and several motets which
he had performed in his Chapel. Music was his
ordinary recreation when he could not go hunting.
At the siege of La Rochelle, there being no musicians
or singers with the army, he himself wrote
out the vespers for Pentecost, that they might be
ready in time. Three weeks before his death, and
after he had received the extreme unction, feeling
himself somewhat better, he begged Nyert, his
first <i>valet de garderobe</i> to sing a paraphrase of
David, which he had set to music, to give thanks
to God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_356">356</div>
<p>Saint-Martin and Campeforte who were present,
each sang a part, and thus made a concerted piece
which they sang around the bed, the king from
time to time joining in with his own voice.</p>
<p>He also wrote a &ldquo;<i>de Profundis</i>,&rdquo; which was
sung over him after his death.<a class="fn" id="fr_282" href="#fn_282">[282]</a> The words
still exist which were written by him for his now
well-known &ldquo;Amaryllis;&rdquo; they were written for
Madame de Hauteforte, and one of the verses
runs:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Tu crois, o beau soleil!</p>
<p class="t0">Q&rsquo;ua ton eclat rien n&rsquo;est pareil;</p>
<p class="t0">Mais quoi! tu palis</p>
<p class="t0">Aupr&egrave;s d&rsquo;Amaryllis.<a class="fn" id="fr_283" href="#fn_283">[283]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Tallement speaks of a concert given once where
one of his songs was sung four times, the king
beating the measure. To these gatherings he
would admit none who were not musical, and no
women whatever, &ldquo;for&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;<i>they cannot
keep silent</i>."<a class="fn" id="fr_284" href="#fn_284">[284]</a></p>
<p>Under Louis <span class="smaller">XIV.</span>, the opera became well known
in France, nor was it any longer a borrowed spectacle,
for Lulli in 1664 associated himself with
Moliere in writing; the latter furnishing the
<i>libretti</i>, which were in themselves of the best
order. In 1672 he built a permanent opera house,
(Academie Royale de Musique) and thus gave to
France, what it had never before possessed,&mdash;a
national opera.</p>
<p>There were, to be sure, a few French operas,
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
before his enterprise; one given at Paris, by
Cardinal Mazarin, in 1645; one entitled &ldquo;Ak&eacute;bar,
King of Mogul,&rdquo; by the Abbe&eacute; Mailly and &ldquo;La
Pastorale en musique,&rdquo; by Cambert,<a class="fn" id="fr_285" href="#fn_285">[285]</a> but these
do not deprive Lulli of the claim of being the
&ldquo;founder of French opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Fontaine tried to write some <i>libretti</i> for
Lulli, which were total failures, and declined by
the musician.</p>
<p>The King (Louis <span class="smaller">XIV.</span>), was passionately fond
of Lulli&rsquo;s music, and would hear scarcely any
other.</p>
<p>About this time, the idea of <i>whistling and
hissing</i> to show disapproval, was invented. It
is said that Corneille&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Baron de Fondrieres</i>&rdquo;
has the questionable honor of being the first play
that ever was hissed.</p>
<p>The hiss, spread rapidly, but on some one
having injudiciously hissed the opera of Orpheus,
by the sons of Lully, the hiss was interdicted by
law in 1690.<a class="fn" id="fr_286" href="#fn_286">[286]</a></p>
<p>The repression was not very effectual, and
innumerable epigrams (some of which still exist),<a class="fn" id="fr_287" href="#fn_287">[287]</a>
showed the derision of the public.</p>
<p>The singers of Lulli&rsquo;s operas had all the faults
of their later brethren. Dumenil, the tenor, used
to steal the jewelry of the <i>prime donne</i>, and get
intoxicated with the baritone. He is said to have
drank six bottles of champagne every night, and
only the sixth deteriorated his performance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_358">358</div>
<p>Marthe Le Rochois, another of the troupe, on
being accused of too much intimacy with the
bassoon of the orchestra, exhibited a promise of
marriage from the fond performer, written on the
back of an <i>ace of spades</i>.</p>
<p>Mlle. de Maupin was the wildest scapegrace the
stage ever saw: her adventures read like the most
improbable sensational novel, and would take as
much space to reproduce.</p>
<p>England&rsquo;s first opera was performed in 1656.
It was entitled the &ldquo;Siege of Rhodes,&rdquo; and was
composed by five persons in collaboration. Musicians
and players were at this time held in low
esteem, and were liable to arrest as vagabonds at
almost any moment.</p>
<p>England possessed in Henry Purcell (1658-1695)
a musician of whom any country might be
proud. This composer soon turned his pen to the
writing of operas; the music to &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo;
was excellent, while his &ldquo;King Arthur&rdquo; contains
music which is still loved by Englishmen everywhere.</p>
<p>Now that opera was established firmly, the
rivalries of the singers at once began.</p>
<p>In 1726 a bitter rivalry sprang up in London
between Cuzzoni and Faustina Bordoni, in which
the whole town took part. It lasted over two
years, and was throughout causeless, as the styles
of the two were entirely dissimilar, Bordoni being
unapproachable in the lightness and rapidity of
her runs and embellishments, and Cuzzoni excelling
<span class="pb" id="Page_359">359</span>
in the pathetic quality, and breadth of her
tones.<a class="fn" id="fr_288" href="#fn_288">[288]</a></p>
<p>But to follow the absurdities which constantly
arose in the rivalries of the various composers,
singers and performers, would require, not one,
but very many volumes by itself; we need only
allude to the disputes and rivalries between Gluck
and Piccini (in the composition of operas,) the
singers Mara and Todi, in France, and Billington
and Mara in London.</p>
<p>The names of those who have established a
reputation as wonderful operatic singers, also
make a formidable list. Among the very greatest
may however be mentioned Farinelli (male soprano)
Catalani, and Lablache, and among the most
successful of operatic writers, Gluck, Mozart,
Meyerbeer, Rossini, Verdi, Gounod. Of course
many names could be added, but these may stand
as representatives.</p>
<p>It is not singular that the great masters, H&auml;ndel,
Beethoven and Mendelssohn failed in this branch
of composition. None of them had the ability
to stoop to the musical <i>finesses</i>, and <i>coups de
theatre</i>, which were necessary to make a successful
opera. They might have succeeded, if the pure
style of Gluck, with <i>libretti</i> taken from the Greek
tragedies, had continued, for these were in their
vein. But the public demanded a more spicy
operatic diet which they were not able or desirous
to finish.</p>
<p>It is well that it was so, for to this fact we owe
our grandest oratorios.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_360">360</div>
<p>H&auml;ndel had trouble enough with opera, before
he finally left it. He had a temper which was
simply frightful (and an appetite which was the
same), and when he came in contact with the
conceited and irascible singers of his day, an
explosion was sure to follow.</p>
<p>Cuzzoni (who had the sweetest of voices, and
the harshest of tempers), was the hardest of all
for him to get along with.</p>
<p>One day she refused absolutely to sing a part
which he had assigned to her; his patience, small
at the best, gave out totally, and he was going to
throw her out of the window, when she hurriedly
gave her consent to sing.</p>
<p>H&auml;ndel&rsquo;s losses and trials as operatic manager,
temporarily drove him crazy.</p>
<p>Rossini also had his troubles in the operatic field.
Once a manager, whose <i>libretti</i> he was bound by
contract to set to music, took offence at some
action of the composer, and sought to revenge
himself by writing a wretched opera for him.
The result nearly brought both to ruin, for Rossini
retorted by writing a terribly poor score to the
words; in the overture, during an <i>allegro</i> movement,
the violins were arranged so as to stop at
every bar, and tap the tin shades of their lamps
with their bows. The audience nearly demolished
the theatre. The &ldquo;Barber of Seville&rdquo; was a
failure at its first performance.</p>
<p>There is a note to be made here, of a passage in
one of his operas, which is of interest to conductors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_361">361</div>
<p>The overture to &ldquo;William Tell&rdquo; had been played
from its first representation, August 3, 1829, for
more than thirty years, with a major trill in the
violincello at the cadence of the first part; (the
andante at the beginning of the work), but on
the 16th of November, 1861, the piece was played
before the composer, who stigmatized as &ldquo;a great
fault,&rdquo; the major trill in the third measure of the
cadence.<a class="fn" id="fr_289" href="#fn_289">[289]</a> &ldquo;It should be minor&rdquo; he said. And
since that date it has been played so. But it is
very uncertain whether the abrupt remark was not
a mere whim of the composer. The trill is more
satisfactory with G sharp, than with G natural;
the earlier editions have none of them any mention
of a minor trill and it is scarcely possible that &ldquo;a
great fault&rdquo; like this, should have escaped notice
so long.</p>
<p>Meyerbeer, was in all respects, a person well
calculated to popularize opera. He knew how to
work up dramatic effects, in which he was well
seconded by his French librettists, and he did not
hesitate at any innovation to ask if it were classical,
or belonged to pure art; and he succeeded far
better than the martinets who condemned him.</p>
<p>At the first representation of his &ldquo;<i>Robert le
Diable</i>,&rdquo; an accident occurred which nearly resulted
in disaster. In the last act, Bertram, the tempter,
has to descend to the infernal regions, alone;
Levasseur (who performed the character) leaped
down the trap, and Robert (represented by the
tenor Nourrit), who should have remained on
<span class="pb" id="Page_362">362</span>
earth, saved by the prayers of Alice,&mdash;after a
moment of indecision (not remembering the
denou&egrave;ment) <i>leaped after him</i>.</p>
<p>There was general consternation on the stage,
for all thought that Nourrit was injured. In the
audience they must have thought that the opera
had a rather immoral ending, since Bertram, the
tempter, had triumphed over the prayers of Alice.</p>
<p>Fortunately the mattresses had not been removed;
and Bertram was vastly astonished to find
that he had bagged his victim after all; he asked
Nourrit in amazement.&mdash;&ldquo;Has the plot been
changed?&rdquo; but Nourrit recollecting his mistake,
hastened back to the stage, where the audience
were astonished to see him reappear, but soon
grasping the situation burst into loud applause.</p>
<p>The curiosities of the opera of to-day are even
greater than those of twenty years since, for the
world has found an iconoclastic composer who is
endeavoring to reform all that went before him,
by pulling it to pieces. Yet he has done opera
precisely the service which it at present needed,
in showing composers the importance of bestowing
a greater attention upon the libretto, and elevating
the orchestra as well as the scene painter to
their proper places; his idea that an opera should
be a &ldquo;perfect chrysolite,&rdquo; a complete picture in
all its accessories, is the true one, though his
mode of effecting it may not be.</p>
<p>His zeal has allowed him to commit a ludicrous
&ldquo;curiosity of music&rdquo; in attacking almost all
that the Jews have ever done in music, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_363">363</span>
endeavoring to depreciate the most prominent
talent of that race; a talent which has been
acknowledged ever since the days of the Babylonian
captivity.</p>
<p>Yet a still greater curiosity (and the most recent
of all) has been written by one of his defenders.
Of course his attacks upon all who differed from
him, provoked retorts innumerable; these have
been collected and published in a compact form,
and the work is entitled &ldquo;A Dictionary of Impoliteness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo; our catalogue appropriately
ends. We have not mentioned some of the
great names in music (Haydn, Cherubini, Palestrina,
Schumann, Schubert, etc.), and have
touched but lightly upon others. They did not
seem to come within our scope.</p>
<p>The incidents in the lives of the musical
giants have all been sought out by persons possessing
facilities which no American writer can have,
and are generally so well known that they can no
longer be called curious. We have endeavored to
show that music is a very uncertain and fickle art,
and continually changing, and that there never
can be <i>absolute</i> laws laid down in this free art, as
if it were a fixed science. If we have done this
and amused our readers at the same time, we
consider our work brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

for set formalities, even on the slightest occasions, such as, the opening
of a conversation when visiting (p. 126), the exit, the rising from table
after meals, (138), etc., etc. It is possible, that in the customs of this

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_146" href="#fr_146">[146]</a>The following is a short synopsis of Chinese education. &ldquo;When
choosing a wet-nurse, the mother must seek a modest, virtuous, affable,
discreet, respectful, exact and prudent woman. When the boy can carry
his hand to his mouth he is weaned, and taught to use his right hand
in eating; at the age of six, teach him the simplest numbers, and the
names of most important parts of the globe; at the age of seven separate
him from his sisters, and let him neither eat nor sit with them; at
the age of eight teach him the rules of politeness and civility, which he
must observe when entering or leaving a house, or when he is with his
elders; at nine teach him the calendar; at ten send him to the public
school and give him no more cotton-stuffed garments, they will be too
warm for his age. The school-master is to give him knowledge of
reading, writing and arithmetic. At thirteen, let him study music,
that he may sing poetry, and that the wise maxims contained in the
verses, be engraven on his memory. At fifteen he is to learn archery
and riding. As for girls, when they have attained the age of ten
years, they are not to be allowed to go out of doors; teach them to
speak sweetly, to have an affable air, and to understand all household
duties.&rdquo; Book of ancient rites quoted in Pere du Halde&rsquo;s Descrip. de la
Chin., T. 2, p. 438.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_148" href="#fr_148">[148]</a>A good example of the ludicrous side of this over politeness, may
be given here. The host in China will constantly press his guest to
accept of things which the latter is <i>expected</i> to refuse; the host is also
required by etiquette to depreciate himself and extol his guest, which
the latter returns in kind. An English gentleman having resigned himself
to his interpreter, the following dialogue (like that in Kinglake&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Eothen,&rdquo;) takes place:&mdash;</div>
<div class="fncont"><i>Interpreter.</i> His excellency has long looked forward to this day.</div>
<div class="fncont"><i>Chinese Dignitary.</i> I meet him now as an old friend, and request to
know his honorable age.</div>
<div class="fncont"><i>Int.</i> His excellency has profitlessly passed &mdash;&mdash; years.</div>
<div class="fncont"><i>Chinese Dig.</i> The ears of his excellency are long, and betoken great
ability.</div>
<div class="fncont"><i>Int.</i> Ah! oh! he is unworthy of the compliment.</div>
<div class="fncont"><i>Chinese Dig.</i> You have had an arduous journey.</div>
<div class="fncont"><i>Int.</i> We deserved it, etc.</div>
<div class="fncont">A similar &ldquo;call&rdquo; is described in Ainsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;all around the world,&rdquo;
p. 106.</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;At last we begged to take our leave, and began violently to &lsquo;tsing-tsing,&rsquo;
a ceremony which consists in clasping your hands before your
breast, and making a crouching baboon-like gesture; it is the equivalent
of shaking hands, only one shakes one&rsquo;s own hands.... Our
host insists on following us to our chairs. We remonstrate; &lsquo;stop!
stop! we are unworthy,&rsquo; say we. &lsquo;What language is this&rsquo; he replies.
&lsquo;We are really unworthy&rsquo; we reiterate. &lsquo;You are in my house,&rsquo; he
insists; and so we back to our chairs, perpetually imploring him not to
accompany us, which he vehemently resists, until at last, when we are
in our chairs, he reluctantly consents to return, apologising to the
last, for being so rude as to leave us even then.&rdquo;

striking. The favorite device, is to draw the outline of a skeleton, on
the front of the body, with white paint. As the dancers twirl round,
the pattern is plainly perceptible when their faces are turned toward
the spectator, but when their black backs are turned, the whole
vanishes, and gives the impression of a number of ghastly skeletons,
alternately appearing and disappearing, by the dim flicker of the firelight.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
